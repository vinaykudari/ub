3,Agency to contain faction violence proposed,"hyderabad: as part of its efforts to contain faction violence, the andhra pradesh police are proposing to set up an integrated faction area development agency (ifada) in rayalaseema region on the lines of the integrated tribal development agencies (itda) functioning in agency areas. the idea to create ifada was mooted keeping in view the experience of itdas, which managed to prevent tribals from turning towards naxalism.the police feel faction violence cannot be controlled by the mere use of force, but it needed an integrated approach to solve the decades-old problem. faction violence claims scores of lives every year and properties worth several crores of rupees are damaged. factionists hire assassins to carry out attacks, and provide both material and monetary assistance to sustain their henchmen. faction leaders were found to be dependent mostly on hired assassins and bomb-makers to carry out their operations. for generations, some families are working under faction leaders, faithfully accomplishing the tasks given by their masters. as a first step towards this direction, inspector-general of police (rayalaseema) lokendra sharma directed the inspectors and deputy superintendents of police working in the region to visit all the 'a' grade faction-hit areas and counsel the families of hired assassins and bomb-makers about the dangers in continuing with faction violence. efforts are also being made to accommodate their children in residential schools with the help of respective district administrations, while the hired assassins and bomb-makers will be provided monetary assistance to make a decent living.

5,SC allows hill-station resort to increase FSI,"pune: setting aside the judgment of the bombay high court to demolish a supposedly illegal construction by a resort group in panchgani, a division bench of the supreme court has ruled that ecology and development have to co-exist for the overall benefit of society. the supreme court was hearing an appeal filed by live oak resorts ltd which had challenged the bombay high court's order to demolish two floors of its hotel in panchgani. the company was entangled in a legal battle way back in august 1998 when the panchgani municipal council served it a notice asking it to show cause why it had constructed two additional floors in its hotel. it charged the company with flouting its sanction which was for a ground plus one floor with basement facility. the municipal council in its show cause notice had pointed out that hotel ravine not only had an unauthorised second floor but also used the basement for residential purposes. with the resort company failing to file a suitable reply, the municipal council passed an order to demolish the two floors. the company challenged the order in the high court. it argued that it had the right to construct a second floor as it had acquired a 3-star certificate from the competent authority. the company cited a 1971 circular of the state government which allowed extra floor space for construction purposes to hotels with 3-star certificates. the company further argued that the extra floor space had been sanctioned by the director, town planning, and hence could not be termed as illegal. but the high court said that since the benefit of extra fsi contemplated by the government for three-star hotels was not incorporated in the development control rules of the municipal council, the company could not avail of any such facility. the high court had also ruled that the use of basement as ground floor was against the development control rules of the municipal council. the company was also pulled up by the division bench for carrying out construction activities while a 'stop work' notice had been issued by the panchgani municipal council following a case filed by the bombay environmental action group (beag) in the high court. taking all this into account, the high court ordered demolition of the two floors. when the matter went before the supreme court the court pointed out that although the municipal council had initially stressed on the environmental degradation factor as reason for the demolition order, the final submissions pertain mostly to development control rules violation. to this extent, the apex court said that the director of town planning is the most competent authority to grant additional fsi under section 28.2 of the municipal by-laws. the very fact that the municipal council had sent the application to construct a second floor to the director, town planning, meant that it recognised the technical and legal authority of the director, said their lordships. what the apex court has in effect said is that the municipal council cannot sit in judgement over a sanction granted by the director, town planning and has to implement his decision. however, the court has asked the live oaks to submit a fresh undertaking as regards the use of the basement.

6,No loudspeakers after deadline rules high court,"pune: the bombay high court has revoked its earlier order granting special permission for staging the pune festival programmes at the ganesh kala krida manch (gkkm) after 10 p.m. the high court bench comprising v. g. palshikar and s. j. vazifdar upheld the civil application filed by residents of tilak road who had challenged the special permission granted for staging the pune festival shows at the gkkm. it may be recalled that in july this year the same high court bench had passed an order relaxing the 10 p.m. deadline on playing the loudspeakers at the festival not just for this year, but also for the next ten years, till 2010. the tilak road residents had challenged this order pointing to a supreme court directive banning the use of loudspeakers after 10 p.m. for all purposes, including religious purposes. while the tilak road residents who have fought a long battle have been vindicated, they think this is too little too late. ""what is the use of revoking the permission now that the pune festival is over long back? we had sleepless nights as usual during the festival,"" one resident said. though the court has upheld their contention, there is no explanation from any authority why the special permission to continue concerts past the 10 p.m. deadline was sought by the pmc itself, the very body that should have enforced the ban under the environment protection act. ""we also want to know why relief was granted then, and is being revoked now,"" a resident questioned. according to a copy of the court''s recent order that their advocate sanjay kshirsagar has received, the pmc has been allowed to ""apply afresh if and when required"" for relaxing the norms in future. this too has not gone down well with the residents who obviously do not wish to have to litigate in the matter more than is necessary. progress of the case *december 4, 2000: hc bench comprising justice a. p. shah and p. v. kakade passed an interim order stating that no programme will be allowed at the gkkm beyond the 10 p.m. and it will be the responsibility of the corporation staff to ensure that the deadline is adhered to. * january 15, 2001: hc bench comprising justice g. d. patil and d. k. deshmukh passed an interim order stating that the tilak road residents should lodge a police complaint in conformity with section 19 (b) of the environment protection act, 1986, if the noise pollution persists. the pmc was granted permission to carry out such changes/constructions to gkkm for reducing noise pollution. * july 30, 2001: hc bench comprising v. g. palshikar and s. z. vazifdar passed an order granting ""relief"" to the pmc by relaxing the 10 p.m. deadline during the pune festival till 2010. * september 17, 2001: hc bench comprising v. g. palshikar and s. z. vazifdar passed an order revoking the relief granted to the pmc.

7,Bike manufacturers happy with helmet rule,"pune: while many city drivers are indifferent to the rule enforcing the wearing of helmets for two-wheeler drivers from december 1, the automobile two-wheeler industry is satisfied with the government's decision. both the city-based two-wheeler manufacturers, bajaj auto limited and kinetic engineering limited, say they would like to see the rule implemented meticulously. kinetic engineering chairman arun firodia went a step further. he told the times of india that the company will start providing a helmet - at additional cost - with its scooters. ""in fact some of our models have space provided for keeping helmets when the vehicle is parked,"" he said. r. l. ravichandran, vice president, business development, bajaj auto limited says the company has no plans to include a helmet in the compulsory accessories. ""our research and developent has always focussed on the safety aspect of design adequacy/validation by metallurgy for frames, mounting, forks, shock absorbers, tyres, crash guards, leg guards and saree guards, which are very critical for safety. but we do not have plans to give helmets as original equipment as we do not have any manufacturing expertise in helmets,"" mr ravichandran said. he said there are many good quality helmets currently available in the market that the rider can choose from. ""our only concern is that every helmet sold in the country should be certified by a competent 'road safety standards' body besides bearing the isi mark,"" mr ravichandran said.

8,Parents opposed to income-based school fees,"pune: parents whose children study in government-aided english medium schools in the city have decided to oppose the state government's decision to impose a fee structure based on their (the parents') annual income. the decision was taken at an emergency working committee meeting of the pune parents' association (ppa) held at the sardar dastur girls' high school on sunday. though the ppa did not have a copy of the government resolution in this regard, ppa convenor sudarshan nair told the times of india, that parents will not accept an income-based fee-structure in the 32 aided english medium schools in pune and pimpri-chinchwad areas. the ppa has already sent letters of protest to state education minister ramkrishna more and other education officials, he said. the ppa is also in touch with parents' associations in mumbai in order to stage a combined struggle against the fee hike, mr nair added. at present, aided english medium schools do not charge tuition fees. the government pays grant towards salaries of school teachers. ""parents pay a fixed amount, not more than rs 1,500 per year, at the beginning of every academic year to take care of other administrative expenses,"" explains mr nair. if the government stopped paying grants, the schools will have to raise the money through a new fee structure prescribed by the government. according to the government proposal, parents with annual income up to rs 50,000 will not be asked to pay any fees. parents with incomes between rs 50,000 to rs 1 lakh will have to pay rs 100 per month per student, while those with an income of rs 1 to rs 2 lakh will be asked to pay rs 200 per month. similarly, an income between rs 2 and rs 3 lakh will attract a monthly fee of rs 300 per month, and an income of more than rs 3 lakh will push the monthly fee up to rs 400. if despite the new fee structure, the schools are unable to raise money equivalent to the grant amount, the school authorities have been given the discretion to hike the fees further. ""schools which have deliberately kept down the number of students to maintain the standard of teaching will suffer the most because there will be fewer students from whom to raise the requisite money,"" he explained. the government proposal not only discriminates between students attending english and marathi medium schools, it also discriminates between students in the same school, since some will be paying more fees than others for the same services. this flies in the face of reason and common sense. an attempt by the government in july to withdraw its grants to english medium schools had been vociferously opposed by the parents who had staged a massive morcha in the city.

10,Fear of violence in state grows,"lucknow: is osama bin laden posing a serious threat to communal harmony in uttar pradesh? if the intelligence agencies are to be believed, he is. even as the al qaeda chief was being shown repeatedly on television news channels, saying the us-led attacks on afghanistan as war against islam, top intelligence agencies have dashed a report to the state government expressing strong apprehensions of a totally unpredictable kind of violence. communal situation in the state may take an unpredictable turn and the measures taken as yet may not be adequate to meet emergency-like situations, a source in the intelligence department said quoting the report. the report further states that it was not necessary that the fall-out of an incident would be confined to the area of occurance, therefore it was important to stay abreast of all developments within and outside india. ... effective contingency plans must be prepared ... the report warns. the home department is learnt to have sent letters to top officials of the administration and police across the state to esnure peace and communal harmony at all costs. directives have been issued that senior officials must regularly meet to assess the situation and inform the home department and director general of police (dgp) up as soon as there is a development of any nature. the warnings are being heeded if what was seen here is any indication. soon after the us and british attacks got underway in afghanistan, crackers were burst and some persons even took to sloganeering. the police remained on its toes all night long and even senior officials continued patrolling in the old city areas. however, the state disaster management agency requires that the senior officials should be alert to any situation arising out of the present attacks on afghanistan. but random checks by times news network showed that some of them were not accessible even on their cell phones. while trying to get across to the dgp, ig lucknow zone, dig lucknow range, ssp lucknow, sp west, sp east, sp trans-gomti and sp rural areas around 5:30 am on monday, all except the mobile phones of ig lucknow zone and sp rural areas were found ringing. three officers, dig lucknow, sp west and sp east even called back on the cell number from which they were contacted after noticing the 'missed calls' within five minutes.

11,U.S. must differentiate between people and govt.,"mumbai: the american-led attacks on afghanistan which started on sunday night have evoked mixed reactions in the city. opinions range from the feeling that afghanistan had goaded the u.s. into taking the ultimate step to that the americans had created a monster which was beginning to devour them. however, most are unanimous that the ultimate victims would be the innocent people of afghanistan. ``ever since the taliban destroyed the bamiyan buddhas, i have felt that they needed to be thrown out of power. if the citizens of afghanistan have not been able to do it, then it is just as well that an outsider does it, whatever the reasons,'' said former judge s. m. daud.``the taliban is getting what it deserved, but i wish fundamentalism all over was targeted, and not just this group,'' he said adding that the experience should teach a lesson to all those who were using fundamentalism to get political mileage. ``i hope the fundamentalists in india and pakistan will realise the dangers of using organised religion to further their political goals,'' he emphasised. yusuf muchalla of the all india muslim personal law board noted that one really couldn't blame the u.s. for not giving the taliban rulers of afghanistan adequate notice of its intentions to attack the country if osama bin laden was not handed over to them. ``under the circumstances, the u.s. attack came with more than sufficient forewarning. as long as these bombings are restricted to military bases and terrorist camps, they are fair enough. the general population should not be made to bear the brunt of the misdeeds of its rulers,'' he said. rector of st xavier's college fr. rudy heredia, however termed president george w. bush's action as a jingoist one. ``in a war, one needs to differentiate between the government and the people of a country. the u.s. government has gone ahead with the attacks, without paying much attention to even its own official polls, which have been showing a steady decline about the justification for america to go to war,'' he said. fr heredia pointed out that war did not stop terrorism, only fuelled it. ``one has to tackle the root of the problem, which, in this case, is the marginalisation of the islamic world by the powerful west and the imposition of undemocratic rule over these nations, also under western influence.'' he pointed out that when there were terrorist attacks in europe by the ira or the red army, there was no call for fighting `global terrorism.' the u.s., he noted, would do well to examine the reaction of its own people. the common people in the u.s are all asking, ``why are we so hated?'' retired major general eustace d'souza pointed out that the attacks were inevitable, given that president bush had to prove to his country and his cohorts in the nato that he meant business. ``but he's been smart about it. the u.s. is attacking from a safe distance, ensuring minimum casualty on its side. it has left all the ground fighting for the northern alliance to do. at the same time, though it claims to be targeting only terrorist camps, it is obvious that the bombs will drop all over the country. terrorist camps, as any war veteran will know, are not huge establishments but a hut here, a bunker there or a cluster of tents somewhere else. and knowing how resilient the pathans are, i foresee a long drawn fight.'' major general d'souza also noted that president bush had declared from day 1 that this was the beginning of a big war. ``but wars are against nations. what nation are we talking about? the taliban is not a country, it doesn't even have control over all of afghanistan,'' he pointed out. feroze mithiborwala of the muslim intellectual forum and the yuva bharat condemned the attack. ``the taliban is the creation of the u.s. they used it as long as it was convenient for them. now, when it turns against them, they launch a global war against terrorism. this is absurd.'' mr mithiborwala pointed out that afghanistan was situated very advantageously, in terms of geo-politics. ``it will suit the u.s. wonderfully to set up a puppet government there, and then use it as a base to influence the politics of west asia as well as south-east asia,'' he said. president of the indian union muslim league g. m. banatwalla too condemned the us retaliation on the grounds that it was against all the tenets of international law. ``surely, this is not how a responsible nation reacts,'' he said. he added that civilised nations needed to persuade the u.s. to combat terrorism based on global efforts of consensus and by abiding with international laws. political scientist and director of mani bhavan, usha thakkar, maintained that irrespective of the provocation, countries should never give up the paths of reconciliations and negotiation, even while tackling issues like terrorism. security alert mumbai: military spokesperson in mumbai, commander madhusoodan, said on monday that following the us-led attacks on afghanistan, the indian military was on high alert. ``when such an attack is happening in the neighbourhood, it is obvious that there will be a step up of preparedness, an increased number of duty personnel, deployment and monitoring of events,'' he said. the us consulate general has warned u.s. citizens that following the military action in afghanistan, there is possibility of strong anti- american sentiment and retaliatory action against them by terrorists. it has urged americans to step up their security and avoid crowded places, particular where demonstrations may occur. it has asked its citizens to maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for travel and treat mail and packages with suspicion.

13,New political party formed in Manipur,"imphal: a new political party, the second within a week, the democratic people's party of manipur (dpmm) was formed to bring a halt to the 'politics of betrayal'. the people had rejected most political parties because of the 'politics of betrayal' which had prevailed in the state in the past and the dpmm would try to bring about a 'new manipur', human rights activist khaidem mani who is the president of the party told reporters here. he asserted that the new party would attempt to form what he termed 'serious and stable government' that would not beg but demand its 'rightful claim from the centre, and share in the nation building process. the centre, he alleged, had not given manipur any meaningful place either in the economic process or in political decision-making of the national mainstream. he said the new party would safeguard the territorial integrity of the state and work for emotional integration of all sections of the people. five vice presidents and as many general secretaries, including another well-known human rights activist r k anand, were appointed. former president of all manipur students union p premananda meitei was appointed president of the dppm youth front, he added. on october 5, former chief minister w nipamacha singh had formed manipur people's conference.

14,BPCL says no to investment-oriented growth,"new delhi: oil major bharat petroleum said on monday that it would not pursue an investment-oriented strategy in the near future but would rather continue addition for growth, with the sole exception of taking up rs 6,500-crore bina refinery project. ""we do not want to make fresh investment. ours is not an investmeriedo trategy,"" bpcl chairman and managing director u sunderrajan said. ""we would rather concentrate on value addition to investment already made,"" he said, adding the corporation had recently made fresh investment in acquiring controlling stake in numaligarh and kochi refineries. consequent to these investments, totalling over rs 800-crore, including that in indraprastha gas, the debt equity ratio of the company had gone up from 0.6:1 to 1.1:1, he said, adding over the next two years, the corporation would seek to use its surplus reserves for retiring costly loans. sunderrajan, however, reiterated committment to take up the bina refinery project in madhya pradesh saying that corporation would go ahead with the refinery without waiting for any partner to join. he said bina project would now cost rs 6,500 crore against rs 5,500 crore earlier due to time delays and would take five years for completion. ""however, search for a partner even at a later date will continue,"" sunderrajan said, virtually putting the possibility of taking a foreign partner like kuwait petroleum to an end for the time being. on the contrary, bpcl, which posted a net profit of over rs 820 crore, would embark on value addition to its outlets to meet the challenge from global oil giants like shell and bp in the liberalised market from april 1, 2001. ""we do not want to know merely as a petroleum corporation. we want to be known as a major retailing company,"" he said. towards this end, the corporation is promoting opening up of sales counters for various products including grocery items at its retail outlets, sunderrajan said. ""we have recently opened a grocery shop at one of our outlets in mumbai... we will try for more such addition,"" he said, emphasising that making bpcl's outlet as a one stop shopping centre would add tremendous value. sunderrajan claimed that despite the slowdown, the corporation had increased its marketshare in petro-products sale from 21.41 per cent to 21.84 per cent during april-august 2001. giving a comparison of the performance, he said bpcl's sales had increased from 162.08 tonnes per outlet per month in 1996-97 to 183.5 tonnes in the last fiscal as against the growth in industry average from 155.55 tonnes (1996-97) to 164.3 tonnes in 2000-01.

17,DU flays govt move to take over colleges,"new delhi: the delhi university on tuesday hit out at the city government for its plan to ''delink'' 12 of its wholly funded colleges from the university. the government earlier said it would not consult the university for constitution of governing bodies of these colleges. the government had earlier written a letter to the university stating the same and quoting certain rules. at a press conference on tuesday, delhi university's dean of colleges kiran dattar said the statutes could not be read in isolation. ''ordinance 30, which has been quoted by the government, has to be read subject to ordinance 18,'' dattar said. the initial mou stated they would come under university rules. the initial terms of affiliation cannot be changed, he added. the issue, said university officials, was creating confusion in the mind of students and faculty. they accused the government of behaving ''irresponsibly''. of the 28 government-funded colleges, 12 are totally dependent on the city government for grants and future growth. these include the college of business studies, acharya narendra dev college, b r ambedkar college, both colleges of applied sciences, deen dayal upadhyay college, keshav mahavidyalaya, aditi mahavidyalaya, bhagini nivedita and indira gandhi institute of physical sciences. the government gives 5 per cent grant to the other 16. according to delhi university sources, higher education director s p marwah had recently written to the university claiming that statutes exempt these colleges from having a governing body. they may have advisory bodies instead, he said. till now, the government was obliged to appoint 50 per cent of the governing body members from the list of names forwarded by the university. meanwhile, the du teachers' association also expressed its concern over the government move. duta president shaswati mazumdar and secretary r s dahiya have called it ''wrong'' interpretation of statutes .

''advocates from delhi have been appearing before these courts for years. but recently several incidents were reported in which faridabad and gurgaon lawyers did not permit their colleagues from delhi to appear in the local courts,'' mittal alleged. he said these lawyers were forcing their counterparts coming from other parts of the country to hire local lawyers for arguing the matter.

25,BCC polls likely to be put off,"bangalore: even as the bangalore city corporation (bcc) and city corporators are gearing up to face the polls due to be held on november 11, rumours are rife on the possibility of postponement of the elections. reason - the government is dilly-dallying with the ward-wise reservation list. with the karnataka high court setting a deadline of october 11 to submit the reservation list for 100 wards of the city, the government has come under tremendous pressure to finalise the list in another two days. according to sources, chief minister s.m. krishna has given clear instructions to the urban development department (udd) to prepare a fresh reservation list by adhering to the guidelines strictly. earlier, a committee comprising city mlas was given the task of preparing the roster, but it has come under fire following complaints that the list prepared was not in accordance with the guidelines. ""there are a lot of loopholes in the list prepared by the congress committee. several caste coteries within the party worked towards getting their wards reserved for a particular community. this gave rise to internal bickerings resulting in the shoddy preparation of the list,"" party sources said. subsequently, a writ petition was filed in the high court regarding this and the delay in announcing the list. the high court questioned the government on the delay even as the election date had been announced. ""chief minister made it clear his government is not ready to face any embarrassment due to any goof-ups in the list. he has instructed the officials not to yield to any political pressure. he does not want to face the wrath of the court if any violations are found in the list. the lists prepared by the congress committee have been withdrawn and the udd is treading a safe path in this task,"" the sources said. the list which is to be submitted to the high court on october 11 will eventually decide on the possibility of holding elections. while the udd has hardly any time to finalise the list, city mlas of all parties are trying to intervene and have a say in the matter, sources alleged. meanwhile, the state election commission and the bcc which are not parties to these developments are continuing their preparations, setting right the discrepancies in the voter list for the proposed elections.
