0,Signals get mixed: Govt or party?,"NEW DELHI: MoS for communications â€” and Khurja MP â€” Ashok Pradhan appears to have overstepped his official role.

His additional private secretary in the ministry has sent invitations on an official letterhead for what is entirely a BJP function.

The letter invites the recipient to attend the BJPâ€™s â€˜Gaon Gaon Chalo, Ghar Ghar Chalo Abhiyanâ€™ to be flagged off by party president M Venkaiah Naidu from Gautambudhnagar â€” part of Pradhanâ€™s constituency â€” on September 25. A minute-to-minute programme has been enclosed with a request that a team of reporters, cameramen and OB van etc be deputed.

Pradhan, when contacted, said, â€˜â€˜This is a party programme, not a government programme.â€™â€™ Pradhanâ€™s APS said he had sent the letter â€˜â€˜as part of his duties as a member of the ministerâ€™s personal establishmentâ€™â€™. Asked whether it was not irregular to send invitations on a government letterhead for a party function, he just repeated, â€˜â€˜ I do what the minister tells me to do. If he asks me to pick up his bag, Iâ€™ll do that.â€™â€™

BJP general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, â€˜â€˜This is a party programme being organised by the BJP and the government has nothing to do with it. I donâ€™t understand how such a letter could have been sent.â€™â€™

1,Farmers' rally in G'nagar on Thursday,"AHMEDABAD: The state unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh will organise a big rally of farmers â€” â€˜kisan mahakumbhâ€™ â€” in Gandhinagar on Thursday to force governmentâ€™s attention towards their problems.

The 10-day long â€˜Vibrant Gujaratâ€™ celebrations of the Modi government begin on the day. State BKS president Praful Senjalia said at a news c o n f e r e n c e here that the sangh would issue an â€œultimatumâ€� to Chief Minister Narendra Modi to concede to their demands on power tariff and remunerative prices for agriculture produce or face the wrath of farmers. â€œIn no circumstances will we tolerate anti-farmer measures. The rally will be a major show of strength of farmersâ€™ unity.â€�

Giving details about the rally, Senjalia said farmers and their family members would take part in â€œmaha aartiâ€� and â€œghantaravâ€�, aimed at â€œawakening the BJP government from its slumber.â€�

He said that over a million farmers and their family members are expected to participate in the rally to be held at Sector-6 grounds in the state capital on September 25. The rally will be addressed among others by national leaders of BKS including Narendra Megh, Dr Kunvarjibhai Jadhav and other office-bearers of the state unit.

Lashing out at the government for not protecting the interests of the farmers, Senjalia said the rally would decide on the future course of action. He said though a bumper kharif crop was expected, he was sure the farmers would not get adequate prices for their produce, and suffer a whopping loss.

2,AMC chief a puppet of govt: Cong,"AHMEDABAD: The city unit of the Congress on Tuesday alleged that municipal commissioner RK Tripathy was acting as a puppet of the state government and trying to malign the image of the party ruling the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).

Members of the Congress have threatened to launch agitation if the commissioner continues to function in such a manner.

â€œGoing by the way the commissioner is functioning, it appears the state government has a design to supersede the corporation. The first-ever interim budget, which was highly impractical, was nothing but a move to put the Congress in a wrong box,â€� said Rajkumar Gupta, president of the city unit.

Alleging that Tripathy was acting at the behest of the state government, Gupta said, â€œIn a democracy, elected representatives come and go, but officials should remain as neutral as possible.â€�

3,Bahujan Samaj's crown princess,"LUCKNOW: The reins of the Bahujan Samaj Party has passed from Kanshi Ram to Mayawati in less than a decade, and it reaffirms the grit and political acumen the former chief minister has displayed all these years. That from a party worker, Mayawati made a niche for herself in the Bahujan Samaj with the help of her mentor Kanshi ram, is no mean achievement for a poor girl from western Uttar Pradesh.

In all those years when the former chief minister was steadily building up support for herself, she pushed the trusted men of Kanshi ram out one by one from the party. It goes to the credit of Mayawati that Kanshi Ram supported each and every step of the former chief minister. In the process, the dalit messiah forfeited the trust and support of many of his friends and colleagues.

The first whiff of protest was heard in June 1995 when the 69-member BSP legislature party decided to withdraw its support from the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. Under the leadership of Raj Bahadur, a former minister, 12 MLAs walked out of the party fold and offered support to Yadav, defying the directives of Kanshi Ram.

That was the first time when the then BSP president openly displayed his preference for Mayawati, casting aside his known and trusted lieutenant. Perhaps, Kanshi ram had made up his mind to place the leadership of the party in the hands of a young and aggressive leader who would continue his movement further. Raj Bahadur was the first to become the torch-bearer of the BSP in Uttar Pradesh, but it did not deter Kanshi Ram from pushing him to the fringe and trusted Mayawati instead.

The second prominent leader to fall from the grace of Kanshi Ram was Jang Bahadur Patel. A prominent OBC leader, Patel fell out with Mayawati and walked out of the party. The two stalwarts of the BSP who walked out with sizable MLAs, 12 and 18 respectively, could not erode the dalit base of the party. Then fell the axe of Mayawati on former minister Ram Lakhan Verma who headed the BSP legislature party till Mayawati assumed the leadership. Thereafter, one by one, from Bhagwat Pal to Dayaram Pal to RK Chaudhary were shown the door by Mayawati in less than five years. After Chaudharyâ€™s exit from the party, the eclipse of Kanshi ramâ€™s trusted men was completed in the party. This left Mayawati as the only claimant for Kanshi ramâ€™s legacy.

4,Badali Khera residents protest civic apathy,"LUCKNOW: Caught in the â€˜pass the buckâ€™ routine of District Urban Development Authority and Lucknow Municipal Corporation, the slum area of Badali Khera has literally become cesspool of human deprivation. Living just a few yards away from the VIP road leading to the Amausi Airport, 2000 residents of Badali Khera are living in a deplorable condition with a complete lack of civic amenities.

With the monsoon exacerbating their woes, 100 residents took out a protest demonstration against the authorities on Friday. The demonstrators first marched to the DUDA office and met the project director. He told them that the area was not under his jurisdiction and he could offer no help. They then approached municipal commissioner RN Singh. He also gave the same reply. However, he sent out letters to the concerned departments to look into the matter.

The demonstrators also took up cudgels against the corporator of the area who has never looked back after winning the election. They gheraoed her saying that the only time she ever made an appearance in the Khera was when she wanted to garner votes.

The outskirts of the city have really been hit hard by the incessant rain. However, for the residents of Badali Khera the monsoon has really aggravated an already abysmal situation. With no roads, no street lights and water flooding into their homes, they have been running from pillar to post trying to get the administration to do something. The stagnant water and slushy roads are a major cause for disease in the area apart from being a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Children are afflicted with diarrhoea and boils and rashes are common.

Though Singh promised that the water flooding their homes would be cleared as soon as possible, no assurances were given regarding construction of roads and street lighting. The demonstrators led by Aidwaâ€™s Rina Adhikari and DYFIâ€™s Santosh Bharti have warned that if within a month the government did not take necessary steps to redress the situation, they would block the VIP road leading to Amausi.

5,Lawyer thumbs nose at laws,"PATNA: Lawyers are supposed to know laws and respect courts. In Chapra, however, there is a lawyer who has shown utter disregard for the laws and judiciary by purchasing land plots comprising a property under litigation.

Giving details of the unique case of â€œprofessional misconductâ€� by a lawyer, sources said the â€œdealâ€�, which has become the talk of Chapra town, involved two-and-a-half kattha of land.

The deal was inked in July this year and two months on, the lawyer also entered into the premises by breaking open the doors.

This despite the fact that a title suit on the land along with other property has been pending in the court of subordinate judge II, Chapra, since 1995. Also, the court has granted an injunction against the persons, from whom the land was purchased, â€œfrom alienation of the propertyâ€�.

Not that the lawyer purchased the land unknowingly. â€œHe is in fact pleading the case of one of the parties involved in the litigation over the land,â€� a Chapra lawyer said. Though the aggrieved party of the title suit has moved the court against the sale and purchase, what has raised eyebrows in legal circles is the fact that the lawyer purchased the land despite there being categorical rules debarring him from doing so.

According to Bar Council of India rules, an advocate shall not, directly or indirectly, buy in his own name or in any other name any property sold in the execution of a court decree in a case in which he was professionally engaged.

â€œThis lawyer did not even wait for the court to decree on the land,â€� a legal expert said, adding he simultaneously thumbed his nose at professional ethics, the Bar Council rules and, more importantly, the judiciary.

6,HC questions Vidyapeeth's selection process,"MUMBAI: Even as the controversy over medical admissions sizzles, the state government has noticed discrepancies in the functioning of the medical college run by Bharatiya Vidyapeeth, a deemed university controlled by industries minister Patangrao Kadam.

Despite this, Kadam was on Wednesday appointed to a three-member committee to decide the fee structure of private medical colleges. The most glaring discrepancy emerged in the Vidyapeethâ€™s common entrance test (CET) for its MBBS course earlier this year. A student who stood third in the Vidyapeethâ€™s CET, scoring 98 per cent, managed only the 21,910th position in the state governmentâ€™s CET.

Another student, who got 92 per cent in the CET, got only 42 per cent in MH-CET. These instances prompted the Mumbai high court last week to question the fairness and credibility of the universityâ€™s selection process.

The court made the observation in response to a petition filed by the Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Panchayat questioning the deemed universityâ€™s jurisdiction to conduct the entrance test.

Government officials also said that students who were admitted in the non-resident Indian or revenue compensation quota, paid a wide range of fees. So, while Shilpa Srivastava paid Rs 26.49 lakh and Shweta Gupta paid Rs 18.49 lakh, others were charged amounts ranging from Rs 59,000 to Rs 11.49 lakh towards fees.

The university explained that the fees were decided after discussions with candidates and guardians to establish their financial position. This also explains w h y wh i l some students were made to pay for a single year, others had to cough up fees for the entire course. Observing that the admission process lacked probity and transparency, the court remarked that the variation in fees suggested the total absence of objective norms and procedures.

It also said that the deemed university appeared to have brazenly exploited its position. On its part, the university argued that it was entitled to charge five times the regular fee in this category and denied that the fees were collected in a dubious manner. Kadamâ€™s university runs 17 educational institutions, including colleges of medicine and surgery, dental, nursing, Ayurveda, law, pharmacy, physical education and bio-technology.

7,Cong fails to nail govt in debate,"HYDERABAD: The Assembly on Tuesday witnessed over three hours of acrimonious debate on criminals in politics before adjourning for the day. As the air-conditioning system in the House was switched off, and the heat generated by the allegations and counter-allegations began to cool down, there emerged a hot discussion in the lobbies among politicians, bureaucrats and even in the media as to who scored over the other during the day.

Emerging out of his Assembly chambers, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu was all smiles. â€œYou have seen it. They (Congress) had no point to make. They did not even make use of the media reports. They better make use of some of your (media) services next time,â€� he said. However, strategy managers in the Congress camp said their legislators have been told not to lose their tempers during the discussion though it is common for the treasury benches to target Y S Rajasekhara Reddy during any debate on crime and politics.

â€œOur strategy worked and K R Suresh Reddy effectively presented the oppositionâ€™s point of view,â€� a Congress leader said. While some observers said that the Congress should not have yielded in the morning, when the speaker disallowed an adjournment motion, party leaders point out that it was part of a deliberate game to escape suspension from the House and prolong the debate on the subject.

â€œIn the end, the chief minister would surely have difficulties in explaining his stand,â€� they said. The chief minister said the opposition did not do its homework properly. Suresh flatly denied the charge: â€œI felt like a pigeon among wolves. I was not even allowed to speak.â€� Naidu burnt midnight oil to prepare his speech to rebut all points raised by the opposition. Though the debate witnessed some heated exchanges, there were no great fireworks. It is to be seen whether Wednesday will be any different.

8,People block road to protest power crisis,"PATNA: The state capital witnessed acute power crisis for the second consecutive day on Tuesday leading to strong protests by local citizens. Normal life was badly affected in many parts of the city as power played truant for the entire day.

Angry residents jammed the road near Tripolia Hospital and burnt tyres. Similar scenes were witnessed near Hathwa market where people went without power since 6 in the morning. Many areas of the city went without water for hours.

â€œThe children could not go to school in the morning as we were without power and water. We had to wait till 10 am for the power to come to switch on the motor,â€� said Sujata Sen of Pataliputra Colony.

â€œMy husband had to go to his office without a bath,â€� said Namita Singh, who resides in Anandpuri.

The cloudy and humid conditions in the morning made the life even more miserable, said Kamlesh Sahu, a businessman of Boring Road.

Power officials said that the crisis was caused by the snapping of a 1.32 lakh kVA conductor at Khagaul on Monday at three places. Due to the snapping of the conductors, power supply to Khagaul grid was disrupted leading to a serious power crisis at Khagaul, Danapur, Bailey Road and several other localities of the state capital. Restoration work on Monday was stopped after darkness as labourers refused to enter knee deep water to connect the snapped conductor.

â€œOur people worked right till 7 pm for the restoration of conductor line on Monday. Work resumed at around 6 am on Tuesday morning and was completed by 2 pm. Power crisis in Patna came to an end at 3.02 pm,â€� claimed the Bihar State Electricity Board spokesperson, Arjun Singh. He said that Patna is getting 240 MW of power and there was no major power crisis on Tuesday evening. However, portions of Fraser Road went without power till 7 pm. In many localities, even after 4 pm, power continued to play hide and seek.

9,Man's suicide leads to niece's unwitting death,"HYDERABAD: In a bizarre turn of events, a city-based fashion designer, K Ramesh committed suicide by consuming poison at a lodge in Tirupati on Sunday, and his niece K Pushpa (21) died when she tasted the substance after discovering his body.

10,"Criminals clash for tender, 26 held","PATNA: Criminals opened over 20 rounds of fire on the premises of railway recruitment office near Mahendru Ghat under the Pirbahore police station on Tuesday. The incident is attributed to a war of attrition among three different groups of criminals in order to bag a railway tender of Rs 32 crore for undertaking work in the Dhanbad rail division.

Railway Protection Force (RPF) jawans also opened fire to disperse the armed supporters of the three groups, including that which is led by a jailed MLA. The situation was saved from turning ugly as a police team led by Town DSP R K Dubey swung into action immediately after the trouble arose.

According to Dubey, the police have arrested 26 persons, including two brothers of the jailed MLA, and seized four rifles, 15 cellphones and seven live cartridges from the possession of arrested persons. Seven empty cartridges were also found there. Besides, the police seized seven four-wheelers from the spot.

â€œWe have started investigation to confirm the participation of the criminalsâ€™ gangs in the tender. We will soon get the print-outs of the cellphones recovered from the arrested persons,â€� Dubey told TNN, adding all the arrested persons are being interrogated, he said.

Trouble began when members of notorious Pandav gang went to fill up the form for their participation in the tender against the wishes of the armed supporters of a jailed MLA. But, an agreement was reached between both the parties. However, the situation took a violent turn when another armed group also entered the bid. All the three groups opened fire in a bid to terrorise their rivals. The jawans of RPF and district police, who were deployed on the spot from early morning, chased the armed supporters of gangsters and succeeded in arresting a few of them.

Eight injured in clash: At least eight persons sustained injuries when two groups of armed men clashed with each other and opened fire in the Danapur Machhuatoli locality under the Danapur police station on Tuesday. At least a dozen rounds of fire were opened during the incident. Land dispute is stated to be the reason behind the incident.

According to police, the incident took place when one Kripanath Sharma and his supporters clashed with another group of armed persons led by Sharmaâ€™s family members Krishna Prasad and Mohan Prasad on Tuesday morning.

At least, four passersby were hurt in the incident as three persons indulged in the clash. The injured passersby were identified as Sita Ram Singh, Sheo Shankar Prasad, Shyam Babu Yadav and Rinku Kumar.

The police seized one DBBL gun and eight live cartridges from two arrested persons.

11,Girls colleges can prefer women as principals: SC,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the preference given to a woman for appointment as principal in a girls college was not violative of fundamental rights guaranteeing equality and non-discrimination on grounds of sex and creed. Upholding the constitutional validity of the Punjab University rules giving such preference, a Bench, comprising Justice M B Shah and Justice A R Lakshmanan, set aside the verdict of the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing three provisions of the Punjab University calendar.

The high court had held that preference given to a lady for being appointed as principal of a government college for girls was violative of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution. One of the main reasons advanced by Justice M B Shah, who wrote the judgment for the Bench, was that ''''if separate colleges and schools for girls is justified, rules providing appointment of lady principal would also be justified.''''

Disagreeing with the high court, the Bench said ''''on the concept of equality enshrined in the Constitution, it can be stated that there could be classification between male and female for certain posts''''.

In appointing lady principals in the girls colleges, the ''''object sought to be achieved is a precautionary, preventive and protective measure based on public morals and particularly in view of the young age of the girl students to be taught,'''' the Bench said.

''''One may believe in absolute freedom, one may not believe in such freedom, but in such a case when policy decision taken by the state and rules are framed accordingly, it cannot be termed to be arbitrary or unjustified,"" Justice shah said. Hence, it would be difficult to hold that the rules empowering the authorities to appoint a lady principal or a lady teacher or a lady doctor or a women superintendent in a all-girls college was violative of Article 16, he said.

14,Hazare asks govt to probe remaining charges,"PUNE: Anti corruption crusader Anna Hazare has sent a letter to the state government demanding that the Justice P B Sawant Inquiry Commission be asked to probe remaining six charges made by him against four ministers including Minister of State for Food and Civil Supplies Suresh Jain.

Speaking to TNN on Wednesday, Hazare said that he faxed the letter to Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Chief Secretary Ajit Nimbalkar on Tuesday and would wait for two days for their reply.

""I was surprised to see that the government has asked the Sawant Commission to probe into only three allegations. I came to know about it only when I appeared before the commission on Monday,"" he said.

Hazare also expressed surprise that the government''s directive fixing Sawant Commission''s inquiry scope was not given to him.

""I saw that everybody except myself had the copies but fortunately Sawant gave me his copy,"" he said, adding that he came to know about the limited scope after going through the directive. Giving the benefit of doubt to the chief minister and chief secretary Hazare remarked that he would give them two days to rectify the omission.

The six charges excluded from the scope of Sawant Commission comprised alleged irregularities in purchase of edible oil by Jalgaon municipality in 1982, purchase of construction material in 1986, irregularities in the Shivshahi slum rehabilitation project and demolition of Khajamia and Bhimnagar slums in Jalgaon. He also wanted to know what happened to the inquiry report pertaining to corruption in Jalgaon Municipality in 1993.

Meanwhile, Hazare has welcomed the order issued on Tuesday by the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court asking the Jalgaon district collector to attach all movable and immovable properties of Suresh Jain and other sacked directors of the Jalgaon District Central Cooperative (DCC) Bank. The irregularities at Jalgaon DCC are also being probed into by the Sawant Commission as asked by Hazare.

The Aurangabad Bench comprising B H Marlapalle and A S Bagga gave the order while hearing a public interest litigation on the financial position of the DCCBs.

Hazare told TNN that the court''s order showed that everybody - be it a Laxmiputra (as Jain calls himself) or poor man - was equal be-fore law. ""It also showed that it was only because of the judiciary that our country and democracy were still functioning. The judiciary has exercised much needed control on the rulers,"" he observed.

The anti corruption crusader pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India, Nabard and Department of Cooperation have already probed into the irregularities at the Jalgaon DCC.

""However, the state government was deliberately ignoring the inquiry reports since the past one year. I wrote to the government raising the matter at least six times but nothing happened,"" he stated.

He added that the court''s order has shown him a ray of hope.

15,Computerisation of dept or benefit to a private party?,"AMRITSAR: The much hyped computerisation of office of local registrar of birth and death by the Amritsar Municipal Corporation remains a misnomer as instead of feeding the data of birth''s and death''s in the computers and issuing the certificate from the same office, the corporation officials preferred to oblige a private party by giving a contract for issuance of computerized birth and death certificates.

The government office have not been fitted with any computer and the work is still being done in the old fashion.

Moreover, the new computerized certificates didn''t have the stamp of Punjab government and only have a stamp of municipal corporation, which reportedly have been objected at many officials outside state and especially by the embassies of various countries.

The new certificate also didn''t have the government issued serial number but has its own created certificate number. As against the government fees of Rs 2, the private contractor is charging Rs 12.50 per certificate which is issued in English.

Sources in the corporation seeking anonymity alleged that the increase in fee had not been passed in the corporation''s house. For more than one copy of certificate one has to pay the same amount again whereas in the previous system corporation used to charge only Rs 1 for extra copy.

Sources informed that as par act the birth or death certificates were to be issued in a language they have been recorded in the office register. In case the certificate was issued in English language a stamp stating ""it is the English translation version from the original certificate number... Issued in Punjabi/Urdu"" was put on the certificate. The new computerised certificate doesn''t bear the above stamp for the reasons best known to them only.

Additional chief registrar, births and deaths, Punjab, Gulshan Kumar told TNN over phone that he had asked for the detailed report of the computerisation of the department in Amritsar to see whether the process adopted was legal or not including the hike in fee for the issuance of certificate.

He rued that municipal corporation should have consulted them before implementing such a system.

Sources in the corporation further alleged that the plan for the computerisation of the department was a brain child of a senior official of the corporation in giving benefit to its near and dear ones.

The private contractor had been allotted an office in the corporation''s building and was reportedly exempted from paying the electricity charges despite the office having air condition and several computers.

S S Randhawa local registrar, births and deaths said that a finance committee had approved the new fee, he, however, expressed inability to give more information on the plea that he was new to his recent posting.

It was learnt that after the new system the birth and death certificate issuance system have become more complex and divided between government and private contractors'' office causing much delay in the process.

16,Waterlogging on new flyover cause inconvenience,"KOLKATA: The AJC Bose Road flyover in Kolkata which was opened to vehicles on August 19, will now be swept regularly to prevent waterlogging at various points due to the clogging of rainwater pipes.

Recently, waterlogging due to a cloudburst, at a point over the Camac Street crossing, led to water splashing over the sides on to pedestrians and vehicles passing below.

The force of water thrown up, by vehicles speeding along the flyover, was so great that nearby buildings were also not spared. Two-wheeler riders dared not cross the large puddle for fear of being swamped by larger vehicles.

Transport department officials noted with concern that there was a chance of vehicles losing control due to the water and ramming into the sidewalls.

""We conducted a thorough check of the flyover after the waterlogging incident. It was realised that there was nothing wrong with the construction. Empty soft drink containers and other garbage had accumulated near the mouths of the rainwater pipes, blocking the flow of water. We have asked the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners to keep the flyover clean,"" said West Bengal chief traffic and transportation engineer B K Sadhu said.

Similar problems had occurred on the Vidyasagar Setu (second Hooghly bridge) soon after its completion. Since then, HRBC has ensured regular sweeping of the bridge and checking of the drains.

The city police and HRBC officials have also been asked by the transport department to keep a lookout for youngsters parking their motorcycles on the middle of the flyover and indulging in an ''adda'' session. Officials noted that the practice is unsafe and illegal, it can also lead to dumping of garbage on the flyover.

""There are also complaints of waterlogging on the ground level near the Park Circus end. Some of it is due to choking of gully pits due to ongoing repair work. There is also some leakage from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation water pipelines, passing below the roads,"" said HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Ranjan Banerjee said.

HRBC hopes to complete at-grade improvement of the northern section near the Maidan end, before the pujas. Repair of the entire road stretch below the flyover is expected to be completed by November.

17,Pak poops India-US party,"NEW YORK: A new Indian-American movie called â€œWhere''s The Party, Yaar?â€� now showing in select New York theatres centres around a second generation Indian trying to shake off a gauche, newly arrived country cousin from joining him for an exclusive bash.

It''s pretty much the India-Pakistan story in New York as Prime Minister Vajpayee and Gen. Musharraf meet US President George Bush for separate bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UN session. Vajpayee''s effort: To shake off Pakistan and push Indo-US ties into a different orbit. Musharraf''s agenda: To hang on to India''s coattails.

New Delhi''s effort to elevate Indo-US ties was to have come through a new agreement on what is called the quartet of high-tech transfer issues including nuclear and space cooperation that was to be announced at the Bush-Vajpayee meeting. But thanks to Pakistani stalking, it isn''t going to happen.

Well-placed officials said the announcement of the deal will most likely be deferred because of what they termed as Pakistan''s ''copycat diplomacy'' that constantly seeks to extract from the US whatever it does with India. In this context, they mentioned Indo-US agreements on setting up joint terrorism task force and high level defence exchanges, including military exercises.

â€œWhatever we do, they want it too, so maybe we will announce it some other time,â€� one official explained.

Other officials suggested that the agreement, which has to circumvent various US legislations and loops to enable tech-transfer, still had some wrinkles that needed to be ironed out. Indian and American officials dealing with the matter have shuttled between New Delhi and Washington over the past fortnight and put in many hours of homework, but evidently they have not been able to wrap things up.

General Musharraf meanwhile has kept up a persistent prattle seeking conventional military parity with New Delhi and threatening that Pakistan''s nuclear threshold will be lowered if India''s is allowed to get away with its arms purchases. The top item on his agenda when he meets Bush is to seek more arms, not only to contain India, but also shore up his own domestic position and hunt al-Qaeda elements.

The Pakistani spin about the need for parity with India hasn''t swayed the US, which, officially at least, has de-hyphenated its ties with the two countries and sees them through different prisms. Still, Washington is expected to offer some military help to mollify Musharraf and buy his continued cooperation in the war on terrorism.

Meanwhile, India''s distaste for Pakistan''s military regime has reached such levels that it is taking extraordinary measures to avoid the Pakistanis. After staying away from a terrorism conference because of Pakistan''s presence, it now appears that Prime Minister Vajpayee will not attend President Bush''s reception for visiting leaders this evening, ostensibly because of Musharraf''s presence. Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha will represent India.

Vajpayee is meeting Bush over a working lunch before the reception.

18,VHP bandh call leads to Muslim migration,"RAJKOT: The success of the bandh call given by the VHP in the coastal town of Kodinar in Junagadh district only worsened its chances of harmony. Scared after the violent turn of events, some families of the Memon community moved out of Kodinar to temporary shelters in Veraval.

This was bad news for the authorities struggling to maintain peace for deputy PM L K Advani''s scheduled visit to Somnath on Thursday.

The bandh call by Junagadh VHP wing was to protest the arrest of 53 accused for burning 26 shops owned by the minority community late on Monday night, after the shop of the Bajrang Dal president Balubhai Jadav got burnt.

""Though the situation is totally under control, this issues do disturb the social fabric of the society in general"", admitted a senior police officer in Kodinar.

A local leader, Mohammad Sorathiya alleged that, ""the police, which was well aware of the situation, could have prevented it"". He claimed to have met at least 17 Memon families who had moved to Veraval out of fear.

Local MLA Dinubhai Solanki and Kodinar VHP President Dilip Kalola alongwith other 400 supporters and VHP activists demonstrated opposite the police station on Wednesday demanding the release of the arrested. Solanki said, ""Balubhai disclosed the locations of illegal slaughter houses in Kodinar and hence his shop was torched.""

When contacted, Jadav said, ""this incident could have been prevented but unfortunately police did not investigate any of the cases seriously right since Ganesh Mahotsav"".

The peace in this town was first shattered when the Ganesh Mahotsav was disrupted in the Somnath chowk provoking an angry mob to plunder and torch a textile-shop owned by one Rauf Kachhi the same night.

The situation worsened earlier this week when Jadav''s textile-shop got burnt and the police dismissed it as an accident caused by short circuit.

Local youths of the Karadiya Rajput Community most of whom owe allegiance to the VHP could not digest the police theory and reciprocated by torching at least 26 shops on Monday night.

Reacting to the allegations sub-inspector BM Pandya said, ""we are carrying out the investigations and will initiate necessary legal action when required"".

20,Police officers injured in clash with dacoits,"KOLKATA: Four police personnel were injured late on Tuesday night after a gang of robbers threw bombs at them during a chase at Rajarhat in the outskirts of Kolkata. Later, eight dacoits were arrested. Several firearms and bullets were seized.

Senior North 24 Parganas police officers told TNN that several construction companies in the New Town area of Rajarhat in the northern fringes of the city have been regularly complaining to the police about thefts of building materials from the construction sites. Special patrolling was pressed into the area after four consecutive complaints were received last week from construction major Bridge and Roof.

â€œThe Bridge and Roof authorities had complained that steel plates were regularly being stolen from their construction site in New Town. We intensified our patrolling there. The construction company had also hired private guards to protect their site. On Tuesday at around 2 am, a gang of around 12 armed youths arrived in a matador and within minutes tied up the two private guards, Subhas Adhikari and Ratan Mondal. After this, they began lifting steel plates on the vehicle, without any obstacles,â€� said Barasat SDPO Bhuban Mondal.

As the gang was busy loading plates on the matador, one of the private guards somehow managed to escape from the location and inform a police camp in neighbouring Mahisbathan. Rajarhat police station was immediately alerted.

â€œThree police teams immediately rushed to the spot, but before they could reach New Town, the criminals had loaded the vehicle and started to flee. One of our vehicles confronted the matador from the front, while others surrounded the area. Seeing that they were virtually trapped, the dacoits started throwing bombs indiscriminately. Four police personnel had splinter injuries, including officer-in-charge of Rajarhat PS, Paresh Roy,â€� added Mondal.

The police opened fire, injuring one criminal. He was later on identified as Mohidul. Amid the commotion, the rest of the gang started to flee, leaving behind their injured associate.

After a prolong chase and a search, eight gang members were nabbed from Baliguri and Lashkarhati areas. Most of the stolen steel plates have been recovered and the police seized three firearms, several rounds of cartridges, sharp weapons and seven bombs.

21,LF partners against arbitrary increase in bus fare,"KOLKATA: Left Front partners are not likely to give a free hand to West Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakrabarty over the proposed increase in bus fares. CPI and RSP leaders have made it clear to Front chairperson Biman Bose before the agenda comes up in the Front meeting on Thursday.

They want the transport committee on bus fares to table its recommendations in detail, explaining the impact of the recent increase in diesel prices on public transport â€” state bus, private and minibus.

â€œWe need to know about the incidence on each such bus and the final impact on each passenger who has to bear the fare hike. This apart we want to know about the additional quantum of state and Central cess and taxes, bus owners have to shell out under new rates,â€� said RSP central committee member Kshiti Goswami in response to the transport ministerâ€™s letter seeking the fare hike.

Chakrabarty had earlier appealed to all the Front partners to allow him to revert to the pre-May higher fare structure following the steep rise in fuel prices.

The CPI appreciates the situation but maintains that the state should settle some issues with the Centre before passing the buck on commuters. â€œFor instance, the Centre is collecting cess from transport owners on account of the Iraq War that ended a decade ago. Why should it continue for so long,â€� CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar asked.

The CPI wonâ€™t accept the draft increase if the proposed minimum for public buses go beyond Rs 3. â€œTrue, the state has financial constraints but the government to appreciate the commutersâ€™ problems, too,â€� said Majumdar. He also opposed the erratic fare revision as and when there was a change in fuel prices. â€œInstead the committee should examine the fuel prices for say six months and then come up with its observations on fares,â€� the CPI state secretary held.
