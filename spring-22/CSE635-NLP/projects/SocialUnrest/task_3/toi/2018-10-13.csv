0,Murli Deora joins protest against multiplex plan,"mumbai: citizens and office-goers at nariman point have been joined in their protest against the proposed multiplex theatre complex in front of bajaj bhavan by murli deora president of maharashtra regional congress committee (mrcc). the cine-complex being developed by larsen and tourbo (l&t) and piramal holdings, is waiting for the go-ahead of the police commissioner. under the maharashtra cinema regulations (1966) the police, through a notice, has invited the public to submit objections by october 15. the police department will grant the ``no-objection certificate'' only after assessing these objections. in a letter to the commissioner of police, mr deora said he was supporting the citizens in their protest because ``the project would create serious problems for the citizens in the area''. he has requested the authorities to review the proposal in the light of strong public resistance. ``the proposed complex will not only put pressure on the already choking vehicular and pedestrian traffic but also make the traffic unmanageable at the end of each show,'' said navin kumar president of colaba-cuffe parade citizens group (cpcg). he pointed out that, according to a notification issued by the state revenue department, a multiplex theatre complex meant a lot more than just multiple theatres. the complex is supposed to have one theatre compatible for stage performances, an art gallery, a family entertainment centre with video and computer game parlours, bowling alley, pool parlour , cyber cafe, restaurants and parking space, which obviously mean that, besides the cinema-goers, the complex will attract a lot of other people. ``this would be disastrous for the traffic in this business hub,''said mr kumar. residents also feel that south mumbai has enough theatres and there is no need for another. ``this area is in dire need of parking space and we will only support the construction of the multi-tiered parking lot at this site,'' said ratilal isharani, chairperson of nariman point association (npa). the mumbai metropolitan regional development authority (mmrda) had given the land to the developers, the sole bidders for the proposal, on the condition that it would provide parking as well as modestly-priced eating joints for the office-goers in the area. however, mmrda is now not against the proposal. ``we are waiting for the developers to get the no-objection certificate for the project to take off.'' said v.k phatak, chief of the town and country planning department.

1,State govt gives HR panel office space,"mumbai: the state human rights commission (shrc) will finally get a place of its own. the maharashtra government has decided to house the shrc in approximately 6,200 square feet of space in the ground floor of the old customs house. the government's decision was conveyed to the bombay high court by advocate general goolam vahanvati on wednesday bringing an end to the panel's office-less phase. mr vahanvati also submitted that the state had issued necessary orders for grant-in-aid as provided under section 33 of the protection of human rights act on the lines of provisions made by the centre. in short the matter was resolved by him in such a manner that it kept the prestige intact of all concerned __ including the state and the shrc. in view of the state's decision to finally allot suitable space to shrc, a division bench comprising chief justice b.p. singh and justice dhananjay chandrachud passed its final order on the matter. the petition before the court was a public interest litigation (pil) filed by the people's union for civil liberties, highlighting the lack of space and the inadequate funding and staffing of shrc. after having shortlisted and offered several locations to the commission, which is headed by retired chief justice of the kerala high court a.v. savant, the state government will now give 4,600 sq ft of area on the ground floor of the development department building at the old customs house and 1,600 sq ft in the basement. the premises were inspected by the commission members, including its chairperson. the shrc, which is supposed to safeguard the rights of citizens, was itself fighting for its due from the state government. set up on march 6 this year as an independent body to probe the violation of human rights in maharashtra, the shrc functioned out of a private office in cuffe parade and nariman point, and was inadequately staffed and funded. the shrc had ambitious plans of having its office located at the world trade centre at cuffe parade, but the government found the place too expensive to rent at rs 6-7 lakh per year. gorekh megh, secretary to the commission, was operating from a room on the first floor of the new administrative building.

3,Attitude training for government doctors,"hyderabad: doctors in government hospitals are being trained to be more patient-friendly. the ap vaidya vidhana parishad (apvvp) is taking the help of the administrative staff college of india (asci) and the institute of health and family welfare (ihfw) in conducting the training. the training programmes, which have already begun, are meant to equip doctors and medical employees with better communication skills.the idea is to also help them develop a positive attitude towards the patients visiting the government hospitals. in a survey conducted by the training department of the apvvp three months ago, it was found that the attitude of doctors towards the patients coming to government hospitals was turning them away to private practitioners. it was found that the doctors were harsh towards patients in district hospitals, area hospitals, and community health centres. the other factors which contribute to patients opting for private hospitals were lack of facilities and specialist doctors in secondary hospitals, revealed the survey. the apvvp deputy commissioner (training) dr m s srinivas rao said it was observed that the doctor-patient relationship did not exist at all in government hospitals. the same doctor working as a consultant in a corporate hospital will treat patients more humanely there, he said. considering all these factors, the apvvp is conducting programmes focussed on leadership developments, communication skills, and human relationship for young doctors working in apvvp hospitals at the institute of health and family welfare. so far, the apvvp has conducted such programmes for three batches of 30 doctors each, and its next batch will commence in november. dr rao said they were also monitoring the doctors who underwent training programmes and noticed a considerable positive change in doctors who attended the programme. the apvvp is also conducting stress management programme for senior doctors who are holding key positions in the hospitals. the programme for senior doctors is being conducted with the help of asci. both the programmes are funded by the world bank under the ap first referral health system project.

15,State govt. staff threaten CM,"mumbai: agitated state government employees have threatened to prevent chief minister vilasrao deshmukh and finance minister jayant patil from entering mantralaya if the state government fails to sanction a dearness allowance (da) of seven per cent and bonus for the current year before dasara-divali. mr deshmukh's announcement on wednesday that state government employees will receive only a partial increase in da and not be paid bonus has generated a wave of anger among the staff. the first demonstration to oppose the decision was held here on thursday. addressing a meeting of the mantralaya karmachari sanghatana, general-ecretary of the body subhash gangurde said the employees were extremely agitated by the chief minister's announcement that they would receive only 3.5 per cent of the central da and that no bonus would be paid to them in view of the state government's precarious financial situation. demanding that the state government reconsider its decision and relink the da of its employees with that of central staffers, mr gangurde also sought the restoration of bonus. at the meeting which was attended by thousands of state governments workers, the speakers, representing different sections of mantralaya employees, condemned the deshmukh government for its decision. they burned an official order specifying the quantum of retrenchment of government staff. the maharashtra state gazetted officers' federation also criticised the decision. in a statement, federation president suresh more and general-secretary g.d. kulthe pointed out that despite its weak financial position the centre had increased the da payable to its employees by three per cent with effect from july, 2000. subsequently, it was further increased by another three per cent from january this year. the last increase, of two per cent, came into effect from july this year. while the rate of central da is 45 per cent, it is only 38 per cent in the state. instead of recouping this difference of seven per cent from relevant dates, the state government decided to sanction an increase of 3.5 per cent, and that too with effect from october 1 this year. the demonstrators also argued that if central government employees received bonus, they too were entitled to it. and as if adding insult to injury, the deshmukh cabinet made central increases applicable to ias officers from the corresponding dates. the move certainly shows the unfair dealing on the part of the deshmukh government.
