1,"Uniform labour laws soon, says Ashok Pradhan","VARANASI: Union minister of state for labour Ashok Pradhan made it clear that the government would not adopt ''hire and fire'' policy against labourers under pressure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or any other agency. He also hinted at introducing uniform labour laws before the budget session.

Talking to mediapersons here on Sunday, Pradhan said that his ministry was committed to protect the interests of workers both in the organised and unorganised sectors. Out of over 40 crore labourers in the country, 37 crore belonged to the unorganised sector, he said adding that for the first time after independence issues related to labourers of unorganised sector were discussed at the 38th labour convention.

The government had decided to provide social security cover to this section of the society, he said adding that a separate convention would be organised soon to review problems being faced by labourers of the unorganised sector. He said that the labour convention, held on November 7 and November 8, was attended by representatives of trade unions and the government. Its outcome was encouraging, he said and added that on the basis of recommendations of the second labour commission, a draft bill would be prepared before the budget session.

Highlighting the performance of the NDA government, he said that the Central government, during its three-year tenure, had performed well in almost all the sectors. For example, he said, there were two crore telephone connections in the country before the formation of the NDA government, while today the number of telephone connections had crossed four-crore mark. Similarly, the figure of software export rose to Rs 40,000 crore from Rs 10,000 crore in the past three years, he said adding that it would touch the figure of Rs 1,00,000 crore by 2004 and Rs 2,50,000 crore by 2009.

Later, Pradhan attended a youth festival at the School of Management Sciences. President of the local unit of BMS AP Shukla handed over a memorandum to the minister urging him not to implement the anti-labourers'' recommendations of the second labour commission.

2,Victims blame shadowy instigators behind riots,"AHMEDABAD: Jasiben and Hafiz are both victims of the communal madness that refuses to loosen its grip on Ahmedabad, the latest targets being Jamalpur and Gomtipur where fresh violence erupted earlier this week.

""Mantri, MLA, corporators.... they all make poor people fight, and don''t have the humanity to come and ask if we are alive or dead. Elections are coming now. Not one us will vote,"" fumes Jasiben.

""We are poor people. We beg and fill our stomachs. If this continues through the elections, we will be dead by then. If not bullet, hunger will claim us,"" said Abdul Hafiz.

The vehement outcry of Jasiben stems from the shocked silence of sister-in-law Champaben and her son Krupal (4), both of whom lie in V S Hospital, recovering after a communally-charged mob attacked their house and tried to burn it near Vaishya Sabha in Jamalpur.

Little Krupal just managed a stifled cry while going through pain from burns on the stomach and hands. Champaben could not escape. After inhaling the deadly smoke for two hours, she was asphyxiated and was close to death. She gained consciousness after two long hours, but is too dazed to react.

""We were caught off-guard. We had dinner and were preparing to sleep when suddenly people from neighbouring Mukhi ni Chali, Khan cycle ni Chali and Subha Khan ni Chali came baying for our blood and set our houses aflame,"" said Daiben, Jasiben''s neighbour whose house was also reduced to ashes by the mob.

Both Jasiben and Daiben swear that both communities in the locality had been living in peace, and had not turn against each other even in the most trying months after Godhra. ""This is for the first time that we have been targetted. One is scared to imagine how bad things would become in the coming days,"" said Jasiben.

Hafiz too is scared for his family of eight. His son Abdul, 19, was hit by a police bullet as he came out of a mosque in Jamalpur after offering Taravi (night prayer). ""Mobs clashed outside the mosque, but my deaf-and-dumb son heard nothing. He continued his prayers, came out and was hit by a bullet. What was his fault?"" asked Hafiz, a ''fakir''.

Mohammad Hussain, 20, is also worried. He was to get married on November 15 and should have been working at arranging money for his wedding. Instead, he is grounded at VS Hospital after a mob slashed his arm with a sword two days ago. ""I was going to buy fruits for Iftaar. I was wearing a cap, and that gave me away when six-seven people attacked me, one of them with a sword,"" recounted Hussain, a resident of Char Toda Kabrastan in Gomtipur.

Husain and his mother were especially pained at the fact that even on the ill-fated day, people from both communities were having a good time, playing cricket and generally chatting at the open ground in the graveyard. ""People with vested interest unleash all the evil, and we people are left to bear the brunt,"" lamented Husain''s mother Zarinabanu.

3,Task Force arrest 3 fake naxalites,"HYDERABAD: Three fake naxalites were arrested by the Task Force team (West Zone) on the charge of attempting to extort money from a businessman at Uppal on Sunday.

4,MIM peeved with govt move on Mecca Masjid,"HYDERABAD: Though the government order that allowed the TDP to hold the Yaumul Quran on the second Friday of Ramzan at the Mecca Masjid was revoked and granted to the All India Sunni Ulema Board (Aisub), the All India Majlis Ittehadul-e-Muslimeen (MIM) is peeved with the decision as the board is known to have a strong TDP influence.

The MIM leaders who strongly protested the GO, that allowed the TDP to address the congregation at Mecca Masjid on the second Friday, feel that replacing the TDP with the board, that is relatively new, is a ploy on the part of the government to make its presence felt in the Masjid clandestinely.

5,TN govt puts a spanner in Tata Tele's plan,"CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu state government has put a roadblock in Tata Teleservices Ltd''s plan to roll out basic telephony services in the state by not giving the right of way (RoW) to the telecom company to lay cables.

JJ Irani, Chairman, Tata Teleservices said that it was more than a year since the company had approached the TN government seeking the RoW to lay fibre optic cables across the state.

""We are still awaiting the clearance. We have not had any official communication for the delay in clearing the proposal.""

The company plans to ay 2,400 kilometres of fibre optic cables across the state once the clearance is obtained.

However, the telecom company is ""hopeful"" about starting ""landline"" services immediately. On Saturday, the company unveiled its national brand ""Tata Indicom"" at the launch of its basic services in Tamil Nadu.

To begin with, fixed wireless and limited mobility (Code Division Multiple Access Mobile) would be offered in Tamil Nadu while ""wired"" services would be offered shortly.

As part of Tata Tele''s Tamil Nadu operations, in Phase I, the company would launch its services in over 25 cities in the state by the middle of 2003 calendar year. The rest of Tamil Nadu would be covered in a phased manner.

The company plans to invest Rs 1,185 crore in the state over the next five years. It hopes to garner five lakh customer connections in five years, a senior company official said.

S Ramakrishnan, MD of Tata Tele said that basic telephony operations in Karnataka would start in a week''s time and within the next one month operations at Delhi and Gujarat would commence.

6,Congress to go it alone in panchayat polls,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee has decided to forsake the panchayat elections in the state for the sake of greater gains - like a coalition government at the Centre with the support of the Left Front.

Keeping in mind party president Sonia Gandhi''s call to form state level alliances to rout the NDA in the next parliamentary elections, the state unit has decided not to have any truck with the BJP or the Trinamul Congress before the forthcoming panchayat polls.

On Sunday, Congress leaders made it clear that they would go it alone in the panchayat elections. They gave two reasons for their decision.

""First, we can''t even think about forming an alliance with the communal BJP after what L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi did in Gujarat.They have destroyed the secular fabric of the country and the basic polity of parliamentary democracy. Secondly, the political euphoria of experimentation is over,"" said Congress leader Manas Bhuniya.

In the last Assembly elections, the Congress had a formal alliance with the Trinamul and both fared poorly. ""The people of the state have realised that the only alternative to the CPM is the Congress. The Congress is the only platform to fight the CPM,"" Bhuniya said.

Earlier, newly elected state president of the BJP, Tathagata Roy, had called for an alliance before the panchayat polls to consolidate the anti-Left vote. ""We do not want to split the anti-Left vote. ""The attitude of the state Congress clearly goes to show that they are with the CPM,"" Roy said.

Meanwhile, Roy has sent out feelers to the Trinamul and a formal alliance is expected to be announced soon. Such a tie-up was made possible after party MP Tapan Sikdar''s lobby was almost marginalised from the newly formed state committee.

While former president Ashim Ghosh was asked to step down in favour of Roy, those like Muzaffar Khan, did not find any place in the committee.

A tiff during a night cricket match played in the town on Sunday is said to be the reason for the sudden flare up.

11,VHP wants 30 seats to contest Gujarat polls,"VADODARA: Claiming that it had helped in ""strengthening"""" the agenda of Hindutva in Gujarat, Sangh Parivar outfit VHP said on Monday it wanted to contest 30 seats in the state Assembly elections.

VHP has urged BJP to allot 30 seats before they finalise the candidates for all 182 Assembly seats, VHP sources said here. However, state BJP leadership denied receiving any such request.

State BJP parliamentary board, in the presence of party general secretary and spokesman Arun Jaitley and party in-charge for Gujarat Ramdas Agrawal, have been giving final touches to the list of candidates before sending it to the party high command in Delhi for its final approval.

12,Govt nod to prosecute 3 former Union ministers,"NEW DELHI: The government on Monday accorded sanction to the CBI for prosecution of three former Union ministers, Sheila Kaul, P K Thungon and Rashid Masood, in different cases relating to housing and medical scams.

While the nod for prosecution of Kaul and Thungon came for their alleged arbitary allotment of shops and stall during their tenure in the urban development ministry as cabinet minister and minister of state respectively, the government gave a go-ahead in Masood''s case for his alleged involvement in the medical quota scam of the northeast.

Masood was the minister of state for health in the V P Singh government.

The CBI had registered four cases against Kaul and Thungon out of which three had already been chargesheeted. Monday''s nod would pave way for the investigating agency in prosecuting them in the fourth case.

The sanction for prosecution was given this morning and was expected to reach to the agency after which chargesheets would be filed against them in the special CBI court.

Masood, the CBI alleged, had entered into a criminal conspiracy with the then resident commissioner of Assam here in creating fictitious addresses of students.

The CBI registered a case against him in late 90''s when a preliminary enquiry suggested of some bunglings in admissions to the students of the northeast in 1990. He was the junior health minister in the V P Singh government.

Since there were no medical colleges in the northeast, the government has a fixed quota for students from that region in other parts of the country.

The CBI, in its FIR alleged, that Masood had entered into a criminal conspiracy with certain officials of the Assam Bhavan and released the quota to ""some other students"" by creating fictitious addresses in the northeast.

In the matter of Kaul and Thungon, the CBI had alleged that while working as Union ministers allotment of shops was done on ""dishonest"" basis in view to cause pecuniary gain to the allottees and corresponding loss to the Government without calling for a competitive bids from general public.

Kaul was Union minister of urban development from June 1991 to September 1995 and Thungon was minister of state from January 1993 to September 1995.

The first chargesheet names Kaul and 12 others, the second was against Kaul, Thungon and three others and the third was against the two ministers and 45 others.

The CBI has alleged that there was no public notice or advertisement inviting applications from eligible persons and also claimed that the people from whom applications were received belonged to a very limited circle centering around Kaul and her personal staff.

Kaul was also slapped a fine of Rs 60 lakh by the Supreme Court in 1996 but later waived it off in February this year after she filed a review petition.

Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed accused the policemen of beating up their supporters ""unprovoked"".

North 24-parganas SP M.H. Harisen Verma is still not sure what sparked off the crowd unrest. ""The Sporting fans suddenly got violent. Missiles were thrown at the players and police personnel guarding them. We had to take action, else the situation could have worsened,"" he said while talking to The Times of India.
