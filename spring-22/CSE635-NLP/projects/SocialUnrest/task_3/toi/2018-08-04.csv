10,State to convince Karnataka on Krishna water need,"hyderabad: the state government, having realised the impact of karnataka impounding its share of krishna water at the narayanpur and alamatti dams and poor rains in andhra pradesh, has begun searching for on ways and means to convince the upper riparian state or a tribunal on the need for adequate release of water. ""we are feeling the pinch,"" major irrigation minister mandava venkateswara rao told the times of india on friday referring to the poor inflow into krishna in the state that has adversely affected irrigation and agriculture in andhra pradesh. the issue has assumed tremendous importance to the state as more than 3 lakh hectares of land falls under the krishna basin ayacut, where the single largest crop is the irrigation intensive paddy. ""if the state cannot ensure inflow on time into krishna, the entire agriculture plans in the krishna basin will have to be altered. this would mean a single paddy crop against the two now and a reliance on irrigated dry crops. this will also mean preparing lakhs of farmers to a complete change of their way of life,"" a senior agriculture department official said. ""it was because of such a scenario we had been fighting against the raising of alamatti dam height at the bachawat tribunal. two of the options before us is to convince the upper riparian state to release adequate water or to seek the intervention of a tribunal but the second option will take a long time as a tribunal will have to be set up,"" venkateswara rao said. one way out for the state is to seek karnataka's concurrence for water release on a pro-rata basis. however, this solution seems a long way off as the two states do not see eye to eye on krishna water sharing. as per the bachawat tribunal award which ended in march this year, karantaka share of krishna was 700 tmcft against 800 tmcft of andhra pradesh. however, there is a view that karnataka cannot be held responsible for the present state of affairs. the state, a senior government functionary said, was only storing its share of water. karantaka, last year, stored 55 tmcft at alamatti at a height of 513.9 metres and this year, it impounded water up to 515.15 metres storing nearly 67 tmcft. karantaka is allowed to store water up to a height of 519 metres at alamatti.

14,Vajpayee rules over a divided house,"new delhi: in politics as in theatre, timing is everything. each step of prime minister vajpayee's carefully choreographed tandava that dissipated the clouds looming over his government proved this. since this is not the first time that vajpayee has held out the threat of resigning, last week's drama and its outcome is likely to be as ephemeral as a summer storm. the first indications of this are already in. relations with shiv sena have not quite mended and neither has the problem of getting the national democratic alliance constituents to behave been resolved satisfactorily. the ajit singh and pmk entry episodes point to a disturbing increase in the instances of opportunism in its coalition policies. but the event compels attention on a host of other issues as well. there was a clever mix of fact and suggestion in vajpayee's ""resignation threat"" speech. the issue of the ability of an aged man to handle a coalition was posed alongside the issue of his health. but the way the health question was posed: ""people also say i am unwell"" bespoke of an agile political mind not above using emotional blackmail. but everything is fair in politics as in love and war. just who are the people who say that vajpayee is unwell ? if they are within the bjp or the nda, then it is a serious matter. either they are right or they are adopting a morally reprehensible tactic in undermining their leader. but the party's reaction to vajpayee's threat, reinforced his supremacy within the parliamentary wing of the party. this was critical in steam rollering the next day's nda meeting and setting the stage for the breaking the tidal wave unleashed by manipur, agra and us 64's failure. the tame outcome of thursday's adjournment motion proves once again, that as political operative, vajpayee stands heads and shoulders above the crowd. actually, vajpayee is not too worried about the opposition. his worries are internal, both within his party and his coalition. the induction of ajit singh remains a sore point, particularly with haryana chief minister om prakash chautala. the shiv sena episode and the fernandes intervention all point to increasing friction in the alliance. so far the telegu desam remains steady, but political dynamics of the state could change orientations. all would be well if the bjp was a united outfit. but that is where the problem may lie. there are indications that personality conflicts may have contributed to the agra failure, with senior aides pulling in different directions. this may be the cause of the party's other fiascoes -- the political bungling in the assam elections, the governmental failures in manipur, agra and in managing the uti. but having used his resignation brahmastra twice, some political observers believe, vajpayee may be running out of options.

15,"Power available, but consumers feel the pinch","patna: in order to paint a rosy picture of the power situation in the state, the bihar state electricity board has gone overboard. in the daily bulletin for thursday issued here on friday, the bseb claimed to have supplied power for more than 24 hours to two district headquarters of the state. in the bulletin issued by the chief engineer (transmission, operation and maintenance), the bseb claimed that power was supplied for 28.40 hours both to banka and vaishali district headquarters on thursday and that even in patna, power was available for 24 hours. the accuracy of not only hours, but also minutes seems to have been maintained while making the daily power bulletin. for example, the bulletin says the district headquarters of bhagalpur and purnia got power supply for 23.11 hours and 23.55 hours, respectively, on thursday. incidentally, the bseb bulletin says the routine maintenance work of the patna electric supply undertaking (pesu) in different divisions of patna hampered power supply for a couple of hours on thursday in various localities, including new capital area, pataliputra, danapur, gardanibagh, gulzarbagh, rajendra nagar and patna city, it also claims that power was supplied to patna for 24 hours on thursday. according to the bulletin, on account of the maintenance work, power supply was interrupted in parts of rajabazar, punaichak, sheopuri, patel nagar and veterinary college for two hours. parts of ag and excise localities and bailey road remained without power from 1 am to 4.40 am. in pataliputra locality, power supply was interrupted between 00.25 am to 00.45 am. similarly, interruption in the rajeev nagar, boring canal road, sheopuri and iti areas was due to maintenance work and repair of high-tension (ht) jumper. on account of the maintenance work at the jakkanpur power sub-station power supply was interrupted in the phulwari dairy, neora and nasriganj areas between 00.55 am and 01.55 am. power supply was disrupted for nearly one hour in beur, mithapur, gardanibagh, anisabad and phulwari areas for maintenance work at jakkanpur. in rajendra nagar, power supply was disrupted for more than one hour in kazipur and nala road for maintenance work. for the same reason, power supply was interrupted in mangal talaab, jhauganj, khajekalan and patna city station road for 40 minutes. power supply was interrupted for two to three hours in the sultanganj and gulzarbagh areas due to snapping of conductor and maintenance work at the patna grid. in the busy commercial locality of baripath, power supply was disrupted for nearly 40 minutes due to the maintenance work at the patna grid, the bulletin maintains. surprisingly, the bulletin does not mention the night-long disruption in power supply on the campus of prestigious a n sinha institute of social studies (ansiss). a senior ansiss faculty member, sachindra narayan, who lives on the campus, said: ""we had to go without power and water supply on thursday. i tried to contact all the senior officials of the board but to no avail."" even on friday, there was no power supply in the institute for the whole day, said an assistant librarian of the institute. ""we had to depend on generator sets,"" he added. similarly, the residents of ghagha ghat in mahendru locality suffered acute power crisis on thursday night. ""we had to spend the whole night without power,"" said a resident, a singh. in other parts of bihar, the power situation was grim on thursday. the district headquarters of sheohar witnessed a major power breakdown. the bseb supplied power to sheohar barely for six hours. according to the bulletin, power supply was later restored. due to a planned shutdown, sheikhpura district headquarters got power for 15.10 hours. the local breakdown and maintenance work badly affected the power supply in araria, samastipur, darbhanga and buxar districts.
