1,Irrigation minister flayed over water problem,"LUCKNOW: Irrigation minister Om Prakash Singh got more brickbats than bouquet in the assembly on Saturday when the opposition charged him with the utter neglect on the part of his department in the maintenance of the irrigation canal network and thus failing to augment irrigation sources in the state.

However, earlier presenting his departmental budget of around Rs 892 crore, the minister promised to increase the area under irrigation from existing 77 lakh hectares to 109 lakh hectares by the end of this year. He also said that for this purpose the government had planned to launch an ambitious project of Rs 6,600 crore with the help of the World Bank to be completed in the next few years. The budget was passed later after a hectic debate stretching over five hours.

The minister proudly announced that it was the 8th budget of the department presented by him in the assembly.

While moving a cut motion, Ashok Vajpayee of the Samajwadi Party said that poor maintenance of irrigation canal network had rendered it totally ineffective and the result was that there was no water at the tail end of the canals. In spite of tall promises, the state had witnessed a steady decline in the irrigated area and this had been reduced by six per cent in the recent years, he said and added the worst was that the situation had become worse during the last eight years ever since Om Prakash Singh was holding the irrigation portfolio.

Referring to the government tube-wells, Vajpayee said that they were in a state of disuse due to neglect on the part of the department to maintain them. He said out of 30,000 government tube-wells, nearly 28,000 were out of order. All of them had been handed over to the gram panchayats which did not have either fund or expertise to maintain them. He further had a dig at the minister saying that the latter had lied to the cabinet by furnishing wrong statement in which he had said that work had been undertaken on 11 out of 15 irrigation projects conceived in the 9th Five-Year-Plan.

2,Here mom-in-law is not the proverbial saas,"LUCKNOW: Banki, a small hamlet in Madhian block , 35 kilometres off Mirzapur, could just be the right site for the sore eyes tired of seeing â€œbawarchi khana intriguesâ€� on the small screen. Here real life saas-bahus can teach their reel counterparts a few things on happy homes and household harmony.

This Naxalite-infested belt in east UP is undergoing a steady change by 40-plus matriarchs who have fought their husbands,sons and neighbours for the schooling of their adolescent daughters-in-law.

Interestingly enough, Banki has at least two â€œkishori kendrasâ€� which have exclusively on their rolls married teenagers . Chaperoning the timid youngsters, normally under heavy veils, are the moms-in-law who either wait outside the kendra or like Ajmer Bano, the 51-year-old mother-in-law of Nisa(19) and Razia (18),join the pupils . â€œI may be better in the kitchen but they definitely have an edge over me in the classroom â€œ, she says with obvious pride.

Things were tough initially when Centre for Rural Education and Development Action (Creda) volunteers began work. There was stiff resistance from locals - mostly Kol tribals and landless labourers, says Shamshad Khan, Creda founder. Compounding the problems was fear of Naxalite violence.The latter kept a close watch on his activities but later withdrew and even promised him â€œall support in the good workâ€�.

The schools run for three hours, from 12 noon to three. Teaching methods have been suitably altered to make it pupil-friendly, says Shubhra Pandey, the project coordinator. So,instead of staid indoor lessons they learn counting by counting different fruit trees or animals around the school.The seniors even get to read newspapers. â€œAnd most are fast learners like Champa and Munakka, both tribal brides who can now talk about prime ministerâ€™s tours, floods in UP and muhnochawa scare with an air of authority, says Pandey. Education helps, says Sazma Begum (18). It has earned her respect of husband and father-in-law who run a grain outlet in the village. Champa, a labourer now counts her and her husbandâ€™s wages and is â€œ earning moreâ€�. However, Khan now faces a dilemma - pressure for admission is growing and there are not enough seats.

6,Kala-azar spreads as govt lacks Rs 2 cr,"PATNA: The dreaded kala-azar may spread in an epidemic form in the Bihar, as the state government has failed to clear Rs 2 crore worth of dues of labourers involved in the spray of DDT across the state. The labourers have refused to take up the work again till their dues were cleared. The government also owes Rs 30 lakh to transporters by way of freight charge.

Incidentally, the disease cannot be controlled unless the government undertakes extensive DDT spray work twice a year in the affected districts as recommended by the Harcharan Singh Committee in the early 1990s. Former Union health minister Dr C P Thakur, an acknowledged expert on kala-azar, has said that the disease could take an epidemic form if the government failed to undertake DDT spray work at the earliest.

The state government has not paid the dues of labourers since 1998. Although the director-in-chief, health services, claimed that the the government had undertaken focal spray in kala-azar affected areas, sources in the malaria control wing of the department on Saturday said DDT spray work had not been undertaken at all for the past few years.

A health department official said though the Centre would meet even the operational cost of the DDT spray under the Modified kala-azar Control Programme, apart from supplying the drugs, the government will not be able to undertake DDT spray work till it cleared the dues of labourers.

Due to the government''s indifference to raging kala-azar in 33 of the 38 districts, the situation is fast threatening to get out of control. The official said despite repeated request from the malaria control wing, the health department had not bothered to make any budgetary provision to clear the dues of labourers and transporters.

Incidentally, the government is not in a position to supply the kala-azar drugs to patients as the existing stock had exhausted. Health commissioner Ashok Kumar Chaudhary said the Centre would be sending 4,000 vials of Sodium Antimony Gluconate (SAG), a first line kala-azar drug, by Monday or Tuesday, though the state government had demanded 25,000 vials of SAG and 2,000 vials of Fungisone.

Meanwhile, expert''s opinion from the heads of the department of medicine of Patna Medical College and Nalanda Medical College is being sought about the usefulness of SAG.

Chaudhary claimed that there was enough stock of DDT in the state, while sources in the malaria control wing said the stock available was only 500 metric tonnes (MT). About 1,500 MT of DDT would be required to undertake two rounds of DDT spray.

7,UP Oppn protests SC/ST amendment Bill,"LUCKNOW: The opposition in the UP assembly Saturday strongly protested the amendment Bill in the SC/ST Commission Act to appoint a person from the scheduled castes as the Commission''s vice-president, which was hitherto reserved for the scheduled tribes.

The Samajwadi Party member Ram Govind Chaudhary said the amendment was ""undemocratic and unjustifed"" and it would create a wedge between the SCs and the STs.

Chaudhary was supported by the Congress members and demanded the Bill be handed over to the select committee.

Minister for Social Welfare Indrajit Saroj, while justifying the Bill, said the number of STs in the state had gone down substantially after the creation of Uttaranchal and as a result, it was being contemplated to fill up the vice-chairman post by a member of the SC.

The house later rejected Chaudhary''s demand and the Bill was passed by a voice-vote.

9,Bank closes loss making branch despite protest,"CUDDALORE: Despite protests by villagers, Indian Bank officials on Saturday closed one of their rural branches in Cuddalore district on the plea that it was a ""loss making unit.""

When Bank authorities visited Palakkollai village on Saturday to close down the branch, opened in December 1983, villagers protested the decision and did not allow the officials to remove the records of the branch.

They also obstructed a van, carrying the records and resorted to picketting of the officials, bank sources said.

With the help of police, which dispersed the crowd, the officials later removed the records to the bank''s Virudachalam branch.

14,Medical insurance for farmers likely,"BANGALORE: The state government is planning a unique programme to provide medical insurance to farmers to face operations that cost prohibitive amounts.

Noted heart surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, whose NGO Narayana Hrudayala Foundation was asked to work out the details of the project, made a 30-minute power point presentation to Chief Minister S.M. Krishna here on Sunday. Under the programme each farmer pays a premium amount of Rs 5 or Rs 10 per month into any of the existing co-operative outfits. The state government is expected to match this with an equal amount.

Any of the 30,000 cooperative societies in the state, including the village cooperatives and the milk unions can be used for the purpose. The National Insurance Company and United Insurance Company will tie up to provide the insurance cover.

``The CM has directed the Cooperation department officials to come up with detailed guidelines within two months,'''' official sources said.

The programme is expected to be launched by October or November. Sources said farmers could go to 30 identified private hospitals covering all the 27 districts of Karnataka for any operation, covered 100 per cent under the scheme. ``This will be extended to 50 hospitals soon,'''' a source said.

15,This August may be driest since 1960,"BANGALORE: Rains, typhoons and flood. Scorching heat and drought. As Earth spins on, days get hotter and the rain pours down. Climatic patterns the world over are undergoing a steady change.

While the changes may not be dramatic and very visible, it is beginning to show in various ways. Bangalore is nearly 100 mm short of the normal rain for the month of August this year. Till August 22, the city has recorded only 38.2 mm of rain in the month, while the norm is 137 mm.

In August 2001, the city had recorded 85.1 mm, and in August 2000 it was 276.7 mm! The highest ever rainfall in Bangalore in August from 1960 has been in 1998 with 387.1 mm, while the lowest has been 45 mm in 1984. Bangalore has seven days left to gather some rain and not hit an all-time August low since 1960.

Such variations are not limited to rain and to one city. These changes are not very dramatic and observable, but Planet Earth is being stressed out. Human activity is creating `anthropogenic stress''.

``In recent years, climatic abnormalities have become more frequent and increase from season to season,'''' says Dr A.L. Koppar, Director of the Indian Meteorological Department in Bangalore. Weather patterns are becoming unstable since the 1970s, and 1998 was the warmest year of the 20th century. The 1990s was the warmest decade ever. The present floods in East Germany and Czechoslovakia have broken 150-year-old rainfall records. China is experiencing subterranean floods. India was hit by drought again this year.

The reason for these changes the world over is partly because of the effects of global warming and partly the twin-phenomena of El Nino and La Nina, says Koppar. El Nina is characterised by extremely low temperatures in equatorial Pacific while the La Nina brings extremely warm ocean temperatures, which affect the world''s hydrological cycle.

What''s happening in Bangalore: The mean maximum temperature for August over the last three years has been around 27 degrees and the minimum, around 19 degrees. August being a monsoon period, humidity varies between 67 per cent and 89 per cent.

Since there are no pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal at present, the weather is characterised by strong winds and cloud cover of up to 70 per cent in the sky, says Dr Koppar. Gaps in the sky allow the sun''s warmth to seep in. So you have warm balmy days with cloudy skies, and evening showers. But the sky is clear by 8 pm and the cycle repeats itself. These conditions continue till mid-September.

Rain pattern

The annual rainfall in Bangalore city over the last five years has always exceeded the annual norm of 970 mm. The annual rainfall in 1998 is the highest annual rainfall ever recorded in Bangalore.

1997 --- 1229.8 mm

1998 --- 1431.8 mm

1999 --- 1014.0 mm

2000 --- 1217.7 mm

2001 --- 1058.5 mm.

16,MPCC vice-president dares NCP to pull out of govt,"MUMBAI: Vice-president of the Maharashtra pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) Gurudas Kamat has challenged the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to pull out of the Democratic Front coalition government in Maharashtra.

He was responding to a tirade launched against Congress president Sonia Gandhi by senior NCP leader P.A. Sangma here recently. Mr Sangma had said that he planned to shortly publish a book which would focus attention on the danger to the nation if Ms Gandhi, a person of foreign origin, became the Prime Minister. Mr Kamat said Mr Sangma assailed Ms Gandhi but he was not averse to his party sharing power with the Congress in Maharashtra. This clearly showed that his opposition to Ms Gandhi was not based on any principle.

â€œI challenge him to ask his party to withdraw from the government,â€™â€™ Mr Kamat said. Mr Kamat said a person of Mr Sangmaâ€™s stature was least qualified to attack Ms Gandhi specially since the courts have unambiguously upheld the validity of her Indian citizenship. In a separate statement, the MPCC said Mr Sangma was pursing a politically suicidal course.

It warned Mr Sangma that Congressmen of Maharashtra would never tolerate any attack on Ms Gandhi. Meanwhile, there is speculation about MPCC president Govindrao Adik being replaced by Sushilkumar Shinde, former state minister. However, it learnt that Mr Shinde, who unsuccessfully contested the post of vice-president of India recently, was not keen on becoming MPCC president.

He is more inclined to become the chief minister. But, the NCP and a vast section of the Congress are keen on Vilasrao Deshmukh continuing as the CM. It is stated that for the past more than two years, Mr Deshmukh had successfully handled the DF coalition and defeated plans of the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance to pull down the government.

It is learnt that Mr Deshmukh plans an extensive tour of the state to ensure that the demands made by party MLAs are being implemented by the administration.

17,Govt behind Pak policy debacle,"NEW DELHI: Indiaâ€™s Pakistan policy is in tatters and the blame lies squarely on the head of policy-makers in South Block and the PMO. The Indian Army remains in an unprecedented peace-time mobilisation that is taking its toll of men, machines and morale. A bar on flying over Pakistan is costing Air India and Indian Airlines dear.

Pushed by Washington, New Delhi has gone in for elections in Jammu and Kashmir without fully exploiting the potential to resolve the underlying political problem in the state. Hopes that US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitageâ€™s initiatives would lead to an end to Pakistanâ€™s support to cross-border terrorism, too, have been belied. His remark on Friday that â€˜â€˜no one here in Pakistan or in India thinks that the Pakistan government is solely responsible for infiltrationâ€™â€™ is an about turn from his early June declaration that Islamabad would end infiltration â€˜â€˜permanentlyâ€™â€™.

New Delhi appears to be going out of its way to accommodate even this new US position. In Kathmandu last week, when Pakistan foreign minister Inam-ul-Haq claimed that Pakistan could not totally stop infiltration, his Indian counterpart Yashwant Sinha declared that India could â€˜â€˜offer assistanceâ€™â€™. Defence minister George Fernandes later amplified this by reiterating the joint-patrolling proposal.

Armitage and Haqâ€™s assertions fly in the face of facts. Infiltration, particularly in north Kashmir, cannot take place without the direct complicity of the Pakistan army. The forested high-mountain terrain across the Line of Control (LoC), with little habitation, cannot be accessed by heavily-armed jehadis without Pakistani army facilitation.

The optimism of Armitageâ€™s June visit has faded. Leave alone infiltration, India is unlikely to see a beginning of a Pakistani follow-up to dismantle training camps and other support infrastructure. All that will happen is that elections will take place without a serious effort towards a political settlement with any sections of the separatists. This will enable the government to order demobilisation which, in turn, will make the Americans happy since they believe that massed forces enhance the risk of an Indo-Pak war.

The Vajpayee government lacks the ability to outbid Pakistan for Americaâ€™s favours. Itâ€™s not as though it hasnâ€™t tried. Last year, it beat everyone to the draw by precipitously supporting the missile defence programme. After September 11, it was way ahead of Pakistan in offering military facilities for the anti-Taliban war. But India does not neighbour Afghanistan, nor does it harbour Osama bin Laden. So New Delhi will now have to up the ante by supporting the Bush administrationâ€™s Iraq venture.

If Armitage appeared somewhat distracted about Indo- Pak issues this time around, it was because the flavour of the day in Washington is Iraq. Friends will have to stand up and be counted. For the record, the US has said it will make haste slowly and consider the reservations of its friends and allies. But it has made it amply clear that it will at some point act. This will open another policy nightmare for New Delhi, but then, regional power status does not come cheap.

18,Exotic city cultures face extinction,"KOLKATA: This city derived much of its unique flavour from alien communities that settled here and spread over time. But the migration of these communities has meant that Kolkata is fast losing its cosmopolitan character.

The long period of British rule in the Indian subcontinent made the Anglo Indians or Eurasians by far the most visible of these exotic communities. Education and sports have been the forte of this open hearted, feisty community, but migration to the UK, Canada and Australia have reduced them in numbers, if not in spirit.

If the Anglo-Indians came along with British rule, the first Chinese came here 220 years ago to do business. A Chinese trader named Thomas (Tong) Atchew set up Bengalâ€™s first sugar mill in Budge Budge. Turbulent events behind the bamboo curtain saw a relatively large influx of Chinese to Kolkata and the 1837 census records that there were 362 Chinese families in the city. The community swelled to 11,000 at one time but is now down to 5,000. The migration started soon after the Indo-China war in 1961-62.

Most of the cityâ€™s Chinese come from the Canton and Shanghai regions and are called hakka (nomads). Mainly in the restaurant and leather businesses, some have diversified into food processing, aquaculture and other professions.

Chinese food from Tangra and shoes from Bentinck Street have become an integral part of this city. Two Chinese newspapers, Seong Pow and the Chinese Journal of India have been in circulation for 31 and 60 years. But the community still prefers to keep to it itself and retains its identity.

The Armenians, too, came to Kolkata for trade. The Armenian Church of Nazareth came up in 1724 and the community, though never as numerous as the Chinese or Anglo Indians, were pioneers and institution builders. Wealthy property owners like J.C. Galstaun and Arathoon Stephen built many beautiful houses in central and south Kolkata, among them Queens Mansions, Stephen Court and the Oberoi Grand.

At present, the Armenians are down to a few hundred and a little removed from the mainstream. Philanthropy and sports remain their principal interests and the Armenian Orthodox Church, two clubs and a college help preserve the identity of this fast fading community. The Arathoons, Apcars, Anthonys and Carapiets continue to be much admired for their prowess in rugby, hockey and other games.

The Jews are by far faring the worst if numbers are any indication. Shalon Aaron Cohen, a Jewish trader from Alleppo, came to Kolkata in 1798 and began an influx which lasted through the next two centuries. But now the Jews are down to less than hundred and most of them are aged and ailing.

At one time, Jews like Moses Cohen and Joseph Ezra flourished as exporters of indigo silk and rice. David Ezra, Josephâ€™s great grandson, went on to become a real estate tycoon. Today a few Jewish schools, the Beth El and Maghen David synagogues and the legendary Nahoumâ€™s confectionery in New Market are the only symbols of Shalonâ€™s legacy. â€œThere was a large exodus of Jews from the city to Israel, UK and USA in the 1960s. The few of us left plan to move to Narkeldanga where there is a large Jewish cemetery,â€� says Ian Zachariah with a touch of dark humour. Surely the London of the East will lose much of its attraction without them.

19,CM to enforce contract govt jobs,"KOLKATA: The fund-starved Left Front government in West Bengal is all set to enforce a policy of hiring people through contract at all levels to downsize government departments and slash the huge salary bill. This was declared by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in an article published in the August issue of the CPM organ, Marxbadi Path.

â€œWe have appointed some people on contract. Now, we are preparing a comprehensive policy dwelling upon the legal and other aspects,â€� he wrote in his piece titled, Strategy, tactics and Left Front government.

The staggering annual salary bill â€“ more than Rs 10,000 crore â€“ for government employees and teachers compromised the state plan allocations meant for developmental projects, Bhattacharjee maintained.

â€œThe non-plan expenditure in heads like salary and wage bills must not be increased in any case. Otherwise, it will lead to a deficit in plan expenditure. That is why we have decided to hire employees on contract,â€� he explained.

Of course he assured the CPM-controlled co-ordinati-on committee that downsizing would not affect the lower rungs alone. â€œWe are trying hard to keep the size of the government from getting out of hand. Enough is eno-ugh. Now recruitments will be done only where it is absolutely necessary,â€� Bhattacharjee asserted.

â€œNo longer will we set up primary schools but build shishu shiksha kendras at the panchayat level where teachers have been hired on contract. Our experience sh-ows the quality of teaching here is better than in prim-ary schools and the kendra teachers are more committed despite being low paid,â€� observed Bhattacharjee.

Some doctors and college teachers have already been hired on contract, he added.

Echoing the new-age management gurus on job motivation, he stated, â€œThis is a major problem for socialist economies also. Commitment is not spontaneous unless the salary is based on hard-earned wages.â€�

Maintaining that the wastage of public money on loss-making state PSUs was â€œun-Marxistâ€�, he called for winding up of irredeemable units and asked trade unions to ensure â€˜productivityâ€™.

Aware that many of his comrades would oppose the new policy, the CM offered to make the contract employees permanent only after five years of service, provided their â€œperformance and commitment were satisfactoryâ€�.

20,CPI urges state govt to hold talks with PWG,"KOLKATA: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan on Sunday urged the state government to hold talks with the Peoplesâ€™ War and probe the roots of the separatist Kamtapuri militancy in north Bengal. A CPI team has gone to Jalpaiguri following recent killings of CPM members by KLO militants. Specific suggestions would be put forward to the Left Front after the return of the team, he said.

Another Left Front constituent RSP also asked for â€˜honest introspectionâ€™ into underdevelopment and resultant discontent in tribal belts in south Bengal as well as among the Rajbanshi and other communities in northern parts of the state. The RSP state committee met during the day to discuss the present situation.

â€œThe issues of neglect and lack of development in tribal and backward areas should be taken care of. Otherwise, it will help these forces to flourish by beating up peopleâ€™s discontent. PW made dent am-ong the tribals and the poor in several states. We have to check the ground reality here and talks with PW should be held, â€™â€™ Bardhan maintained.

While supporting the governmentâ€™s crackdown on violent groups, he however opposed police brutalities. â€œYou have to take action against violence, but that does not sanction police brutalities. Police cannot solve socio-political problems,â€™â€™ said the veteran Left leader.

Both CPM and CPI favoured talks between PW and Telugu Desamin Andhra, base of the Naxalite group. The underground Maoists have recently reiterated their desire to hold talks with the West Bengal government too, pending police action and release of its arrested supporters. Earlier, CPMâ€™s Anil Biswas also indicated the possibility of a dialogue provided the PW quit the track of violence.
