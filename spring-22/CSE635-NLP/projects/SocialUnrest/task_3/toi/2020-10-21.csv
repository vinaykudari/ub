1,IT bosses seek assurance on rally trouble,"KOLKATA: The state government may have obtained a stay on Justice Amitava Lalaâ€™s order restricting rallies on weekdays, but political processions continue to rankle businessmen.

On Monday, state information technology secretary G.D. Gautama and senior Webel officials had a taste of investorsâ€™ discomfiture with frequent bandhs and rallies at a meeting called to discuss ways to make West Bengal an IT powerhouse.

Gautama had to spend the major part of the one-and-ahalf hour meeting at Webel Bhavan explaining that the government was conscious of the special needs of the IT industry and was taking steps to ensure that these units could operate unhindered 365 days a year. Conferring â€˜public utility statusâ€™ to IT and ITenabled services (ITES) firms showed the governmentâ€™s seriousness to prevent disruption of work at the Salt Lake electronics complex, he explained.

â€œWe will provide special laminated stickers to vehicles carrying employees of IT companies on bandh days so that your work doesnâ€™t suffer,â€� Gautama said. So how bad does it really get for these companies on bandh days? BNKeSolutions executive director Nirmal Bagaria said he had to ferry employees in ambulances to the workplace.

â€œBut this did not work for long because once the agitators got wind of the practice, some of them came and damaged the vehicles, threatening the security of our staff,â€� he said. None of those present, however, expressed any doubt about the stateâ€™s tremendous potential in the IT arena.

â€œWe are sure West Bengal has all it takes to emerge as one of the top three states in IT by 2010,â€� Convergence Contact Center director Rahul Todi said. The state had urged Reliance, Bharti, BSNL and VSNL to improve connectivity at Salt Lake, Gautama informed. Talks were also on with the state urban development department to increase the built-up area at Salt Lake, he added. Software exports from West Bengal were Rs 1,200 crore last year.

2,MIM ready to face polls: Asad,"HYDERABAD: The Majlis-e-Itehad-ul-Muslimeen (MIM) eager to go to polls at short notice and prepared to face the electorate.

The party is confident of winning seats outside the twin cities. MIM floor leader Asaduddin Owaisi, in an interview with The Times of India on Tuesday, said that the ruling TDP was not riding any sympathy wave after Alipiri incident.

â€œOur party has geared up for polls since Karwan byelection. The MIM has chalked out a strategy for elections to win some seats outside the twin cities and regain the Assembly constituencies like Asif Nagar which we lost in last elections,â€� he said.

Owaisi was non-committal on his party alliance with the Congress saying that it was too early to speak about alliance.

The minorities, including some middle class people who used to vote for TDP, are doubting the secular credentials of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu for continuing his support to BJP led NDA government at centre even after Gujarat carnage, the MIM leader said.

Replying to a question on the impact of Telengana movement on polls, he said:â€� Yes it would have. There is a breach of six point formula and underdevelopment in Telangana region. It is not required for political party to include this in manifesto to make it a poll issue.â€�

When pointed that MBT, a break away group of MIM, expressed readiness for talks with MIM on polls, he said,â€� two diametrically opposite things cannot take place. On one hand, it levelled baseless allegations against our MLA. On the other hand, it is ready for talks.â€�

When asked about allegations that his family was dominating the MIM party, he said that there was no dictatorship and people had elected him and his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi but not MIM workers. Replying to a question on his joining national politics, he said, â€œthe party president would decide which election I should contest and from where should I contest.â€�

Referring to the development of Old City, he doubted the governmentâ€™s commitment on the issue. He alleged that development in Old City was not on par with other parts of the state capital.

â€œHardly Rs 1.20 crore budget is allocated to Quli Qutub Shah Urban Development Authority, of which Rs 75 lakh is spent on salaries of the staff. The government had failed to keep up its promise, given during National Games, that it would allocate Rs 1 crore to develop Quli Qutub Shah stadium,â€� he said.

About promotion of Urdu language, Owaisi said, â€œYou donâ€™t find a person even at Chief Minister Office to take a petition in Urdu language leave alone district administration,â€� he said.

3,Crackers pack more bang than allowed by law,"MUMBAI: An aircraft takes off at 125 decibelsâ€”the noise level that the government has set as the limit for firecrackers. But many firecracker manufacturers blatantly flout even this restriction, according to a survey by the Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG).

The average level of noise emanated by firecrackers tested by the group earlier this month by the was 138 decibels, members of the group said.

The group collected samples of four kinds of firecrackers, including the chain bomb.

â€œThe sound generated by them was considerably in excess of the permissible limit,â€™â€™ said Sumaira Abdulali of BEAG, adding that all the samples were manufactured in the state.

The samples were collected on October 7 from shops in Mohammed Ali Road and tested on October 8 and October 9. The findings have been sent to the police and other officials concerned. â€œNone of the firecracker boxes carried the decibel level of the crackers,â€™â€™ she said.

On Tuesday, the group tested crackers that had the decibel level mentioned on the boxes. â€œEven the low-decibel â€˜lightbasedâ€™ crackers emanated a sound of 75 to 110 decibels,â€™â€™Ms Abdulali said.

However, Natubhai Mehta, the vice president of Federation of All India Fireworks Association, maintained that all manufacturers were abiding by the decibel level set by the government.

The noise generated by the chain cracker has been reduced from 130-odd decibels in the past to 105 decibels now, he said. Earlier, there were 20,000 crackers in one chain, but now manufacturers add only 10,000, he said.

â€œIf the chemical mixture in these crackers was two grams earlier, it is now just one gram,â€™â€™ he said. â€œBefore the Supreme Court order, the decibel level of bombs was 130 to 150, now it is 113 to 115.â€™â€™

But R.M Kulkarni, the regional officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board,wasnâ€™t sure how manufacturers were reducing the sound level of their crackers. He added that even for a city like Mumbai, where citizens are routinely exposed to 60-decibel level sound, 125 was too harsh.

Anti-noise activist Yashwant Oke said that a small child exposed to this noise level may go permanently deaf. He added that a few years ago the Calcutta high court in a ruling set the decibel level of firecrackers at 65, which is ideal.

Activists allege that the Rs 700-crore strong firecracker lobby managed to get a higher limit set.

Some manufacturers are following the directives issued by the Department of Explosives banning the manufacture, sale or use of crackers generating noise level exceeding 125 decibels, activists say. But it is the illegal cracker industry that is flouting the limit most, they add.

4,Metro seals off section selling farm produce,"BANGALORE: Metro Cash & Carry has sealed off the section designated for agricultural products at its distribution centre in Yeshwantpur. The firm said it would not be selling vegetables, fruits and cereals as permission for the same had not been received as yet.

The Karnataka government on Tuesday said the German multinational does not have a permit to sell 119 agriculture products at wholesale prices.

APMC minister Basavaraj Patil (Sasnur) told reporters: â€œUnder the APMC Act, they cannot sell at wholesale prices any of the 119 products, including rice and other foodgrains. They can only sell them at retail prices.â€™â€™

As per the Act, wholesalers of agricultural products are allowed to operate only out of designated yards. Metroâ€™s Yeshwantpur facility is not within an APMC designated area and hence cannot sell agricultural products.

Patil said Metro has not approached the government for a wholesale permit. â€œWe will have to take legal action against them if it is selling these products at wholesale prices. I will hold discussions with them within two days to find out the actual situation,â€™â€™ he added.

Metro Cash & Carry India managing director Harsh Bahadur said the company was expecting the necessary permission to come through before the launch of the facility but that this had not happened. He said he was still hopeful about an early resolution of the issue.

However, supporting the contention of wholesale traders, the minister said APMC Act would have to be amended if Metro is to be permitted to sell at wholesale prices.â€œPresently, they can stock only up to 60 quintals of any one product and a total of 100 quintals of all agriculture products,â€™â€™ he maintained.

The interests of traders at APMC yard would be protected. â€œIf Metro wants to, it can operate out of the yard. But they should not harm its interests,â€™â€™ he declared.

The company, meanwhile, claims to have already made substantial investments in improving the quality of agricultural produce, as also in transporting, grading and packaging these. Globally, about 8 to 10 per cent of Metroâ€™s revenues comes from fruits and vegetables.

5,City blessed with 4 cm bonus rain,"HYDERABAD: The city continued to receive bonus showers from the rain gods on Tuesday with 4 cm pouring down by evening.

As on Monday, streets in several localities â€” Nallakunta, Basheerbagh, Moazam Jahi Market, Ameerpet, Old MLA Quarters, Hyderguda, Lakdi-ka-Pul â€” were waterlogged.

The chief minister called a meeting and sent out instructions to MCH, Huda and traffic police to be alert â€” especially with the Afro-Asian Games approaching â€” to waterlogging and traffic jams.

The northwest monsoon in concert with a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal brought copious rain to several parts of Telangana, Rayalaseema, and south Andhra with Nellore receiving 13 cm.

Meteorological department director C V V Bhadram said the low pressure was still stationary and forecast widespread rainfall over south Telangana, south coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema in the next 24 hours.

7,Uttaranchal minister will fight it out,"DEHRA DUN: Former Uttranchal minister Harak Singh Rawat said on Tuesday that he would file a defamation lawsuit against those who linked his name with a single mother named Jaini in June this year.

â€˜â€˜That one single act by my opponents has ruined me, but I will do everything possible to defend my honour,â€™â€™ Rawat told Times News Network. Rawat said that first he would try to identify those who were behind his â€˜â€˜image tarnishing gameâ€™â€™ and then proceed further.

The DNA test of Rawatâ€™s blood sample has turned out positive. He had to resign from his post following allegations by 24-year-old Jaini from Assam that he was the father of her child. â€˜â€˜I am not very keen on returning to ministerial birth now, but if chief minister deems fit, I might consider,â€™â€™ he said.

Rawatâ€™s stance is likely to further cause a rift in the party. While Rawat is still awaiting the final verdict in his case, internal dissensions in the state unit of the party do not seem to end. Fed up with continued intra-party strife, chief minister N D Tiwari has had to accomodate as many as eleven MLAs in his cabinet.

8,BJP in fix over Rasne's role in riot,"PUNE: The BJP on Tuesday convened a press conference to condemn the attack by stall owners on the office and home of its leaders. However, city BJP chief Anil Shirole and MP Pradeep Rawat had a tough time explaining the role of its own corporator, Hemant Rasne, in Tuesdayâ€™s rioting.

When the violence began at the Phule market (Mandai) against a civic squad, which had come to evict illegal firework stall owners, Rasne allegedly instigated the stall owners. Shirole and Rawat had a tough time explaining to reporters why the party had not taken any action against Rasne.

â€œThe police are investigating the case and will find out who are guilty for the attack on the civic staff and officers. I have told them to book the accused, irrespective of political affiliations,â€� Rawat said.

Shirole claimed that Rasne has conveyed to the party that he was being falsely implicated in the case. â€œRasne had only urged the civic staff that they should give the stall owners some time to remove the stalls. He categorically told us that at no stage had he instigated the stall owners to attack officials,â€� Shirole said.

The PMC Employeesâ€™ Union and the PMCâ€™s Engineersâ€™ Association, however, have no doubts about Rasneâ€™s involvement in the assault on Molak. The union, in its official release, alleged that the rioting mob was about to set zonal commissioner Dnyaneshwar Molak on fire by pouring kerosene on him. But he was saved by local residents. The police, however, have not confirmed this version.

Union leader Mukta Manohar has warned that the civic staff will resort to an indefinite strike if Rasne was not arrested by 11 am on Wednesday. Interestingly, former Congress corporator Sagre, who has been arrested, also told reporters that he was being falsely implicated in the case. â€œI was only acting as a mediator between the stall owners and the PMC officers because many of the stall owners were from my former constituency,â€� he said.

9,Health minister 'pleasantly surprised',"LUCKNOW: Here was a VVIP who posed as a commoner and, luckily enough, got all the right attention.

Health minister Rajveer Singh on Tuesday paid a surprise visit to Jhalkari Bai, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Dufferin and Balrampur hospitals incognito and could succeed in getting all the facilities he demanded without any hitch.

The demands included calling for an ambulance for emergency duty in Jhalkari Bai which promptly arrived at the ministerâ€™s call. The minister put up the same demand at the civil and Balrampur hospitals and the demand was promptly obliged. However, at Dufferin. the ambulance was not available. Singh was told that the driver had gone on leave and the ambulance service was temporarily withdrawn.

In fact, Dufferin was obviously caught on the wrong foot as the minister found the premises dirty and unhygienic and, upon inquiry, was told that fourth class employees were on leave. The minister, thereupon, issued a terse warning to the staff.

Singh also checked the duty registers, stock of medicines and took their samples, too. He also interacted with physicians and discussed their problems freely. He assured them that the government would take their problems seriously and would make all possible efforts to sort them out in amicable way.

10,No headway in lawyer's murder case,"PATNA: Though Patna police are working on different theories, the sensational killing case of Patna High Court lawyer Pramod Kumar Jha remained shrouded in mystery on Tuesday.

Jha was shot in Anandpuri area under the Srikrishnapuri police station on Monday morning. The criminals committed the crime in full public view in broad daylight.

""We are trying to collect information about Jha''s links, if any, in the world of crime. The matter is of an advocate''s killing. So, we will disclose any progress in our investigation in this case only after collecting concrete evidence,"" said a senior police officer on the condition of anonymity. According to him, the police are checking the veracity of reports about a party hosted in an apartment on Exhibition Road a day before the incident. ""There is information about the presence of Jha at the party,"" the source said.

Police feel that the murder was pre-planned. ""Such crimes cannot be executed without a conspiracy, planned well in advance,"" police sources said.

Sources said the police are studying the cases taken up by the slain advocate to find out if anyone, against whom Jha might have taken up the case, had enmity with him.

However, the police are yet to make any arrest in this case. Soon after the murder, the police suspected the involvement of the lawyer''s brother, Kishore Kumar Jha, as a conspirator in this case on the basis of information given by the advocate''s lawyer. But the police are yet to get any evidence of enmity between the lawyer and his brother. Incidentally, Kishore is presently lodged in Beur jail in connection with a kidnapping case.

11,Khunkhunji shop dacoity accused arrested,"LUCKNOW: The Special Task Force (STF) on Tuesday arrested one person allegedly involved in the much publicised daylight Khunkhunji dacoity incident in which armed youths struck at the popular jewellery store at Indira Nagar and decamped with ornaments of gold and precious stones on July 17 last.

The trans-Gomti police and the STF had earlier focused on the case but were unable to collect any vital clue regarding the miscreants.

SSP STF Vishwakarma, briefing about the arrest said that Basant Joshi was rounded up following specific information about his involvement in the crime. A resident of Khurrum Nagar, Basant reportedly admitted during interrogation that he was involved in the murder of a trader in Meerut about a year ago. He had also been involved in the murder of a Muzaffarnagar resident two years ago.

Basant was involved in an encounter with the police in Mathura about three years ago when he was speeding away in a car with his associates after kidnapping a man and rammed into another vehicle. With his eight other gang members, Basant admitted his involvement in Khunkhunji robbery.

SP STF Anant Deo said that Basant admitted that on July 14, his associate Sudhir Singh called him to Kanpur and they met at the Harshnagar residence of their third friend Sanjay Singh. There Basant also met Jawed and another unidentified youth with them. On Jawedâ€™s suggestion to rob a four-wheeler to commit a dacoity in Lucknow, they robbed a light green Lancer from Company Bagh area in Kanpur on July 15.

Thereafter, the gang reached Unnao and finally Lucknow at around 4 am on July 17 and went to room number 8 of the Lal Bahadur Shastri hostel of Lucknow University. At around 10 am, they went to a motor garage to get the Lancer tuned for the final show and, after a short survey, targeted the jewellery store. Basant claimed that he stayed back in the car while the rest walked into the store and returned around 20 minutes later. They were carrying around 9 kg gold ornaments and the gang left for Madiaon where he got down while the rest went ahead.

DySP STF Arvind Chaturvedi said that the other members of the gang were identified as Jawed, Ikram, Shakir, Mashroof and Denu, all belonging to Faridabad, along with Zakir of Gurgaon and Sudhir Singh of Agra. Basant, however, feigned ignorance about the location of his other associates and the booty or the car used in the crime.

12,State govt to simplify promotion procedures,"PATNA: The state government has decided to simplify promotion procedures of its employees. This was decided at a cabinet meeting held here on Tuesday.

The cabinet vigilance would make available the report twice a year about the cases of those employees who have been chargesheeted. On the basis of the report, a detailed report would be prepared in the department concerned. Similarly, Lokayukta would also send his recommendations twice in a year. This would be applicable both for gazetted and non-gazetted employees of the government.

In another decision, four command development areas â€” Kosi, Sone, Gandak and Budhir (Kiul) â€” would now be under the administrative control of the water resource development department. Till date these command areas were under the agriculture department.

The cabinet has sanctioned a sum of Rs 5.66 lakh to the Sanskrit Academy and a sum of Rs 8.50 lakh to the Magahi Academy. The cabinet has also sanctioned a sum of Rs 7.50 lakh to the Bihar Shia Waqf Board.

13,By-polls a litmus test for SP-led Govt,"LUCKNOW: The by-elections to the Harora (Saharanpur) and Mahsi (Bahraich) constituencies are being perceived as the first litmus test for the Samajwadi Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh.

Bypolls to the two constituencies are scheduled for November 20. Harora, a reserved seat, had fallen vacant following the resignation of former chief minister and BSP president Mayawati while the Mahsi seat had fallen vacant following the death of the sitting BSP MLA Ali Bahadur.

While deliberations are still being held amongst other political parties on the candidates to be fielded by them, the Samajwadi Party has been the first to announce the candidates. The party has repeated both its candidates â€” Vimla Rakesh is the candidate for Harora while Dilip Verma is for Mahsi.

Vimla, who had won from the Harora seat two times earlier, is being perceived as a force to reckon with. Though the victory of margin between her and Mayawati was considerable (against her 41,900 votes Mayawati had polled 70,800 votes) in the last assembly elections, her candidature in the changed political scenario is not being taken lightly by her rivals also.

Harora has a sizeable section of Scheduled Castes population, enabling it to get the â€˜reserved seatâ€™ status. Also present in considerable strength here are Muslims and Gujjars. The constituency, however, has never been perceived as the â€˜home turfâ€™ of any particular political party.

â€œWe have a strong candidate in the constituency and there is no reason why she would not fare well,â€� said a SP leader. He held near similar views on the Mahsi seat.

Falling in the general category, Mahsi has a good representation of Brahmins, Thakurs and Muslims. Also present in sizeable number here are the backwards, including Lodhs, Kurmis and Yadavs. It is this caste combination which determines the choice of the candidate in Mahsi. The SP has fielded a Kurmi. â€œWe are assured of not only the BC votes but also of the upper castes and the Muslims,â€� opined the SP leader.

While other political parties are yet to open their cards vis a vis the choice of candidates, the Congress and the BJP are expected to announce the names in a couple of days. BJP spokesman Hirday Narain Dixit stated that the State Election Committee had â€œvested all rights on this count with the state president Vinay Katiyar who, after consulting the partyâ€™s central parliamentary board, will make the announcement soon.â€�

Congress party spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh said discussions on the candidateâ€™s name for Harora were held in Delhi on Monday and deliberations for the Mahsi candidate would take place in the next couple of days.

The BSP, which had held both the seats, has not yet announced its candidates.

Also worth watching is whether the allies of the rainbow coalition, particularly the Rashtriya Kranti Party of Kalyan Singh and the Rashtriya Lok Dal of Ajit Singh will be fielding any candidate and whether, in the circumstances, the contest will end up as a â€˜friendly oneâ€™.

RLD MLC Munna Singh Chauhan said the party had decided against fielding any candidate in Harora while it will hold a meeting in Mahsi on Wednesday and, depending on the response, it would take a decision there.

While the RLD is still undecided about fielding its candidate from Mahsi, the RKP president has appealed to the alliance partners to support the SP candiates in the two constituencies.

14,BSP protest march on Wednesday,"LUCKNOW: Thousands of Bahujan Samaj Party workers have started thronging the city to participate in protest march on Wednesday in support of former chief minister and party president Mayawati.

The party workers are arriving from various modes of transport to express solidarity with the party president.

â€œBehanji sanghursh karo hum tumhare saath hainâ€� and â€œJo tumse takrayega choor choor ho jayegaâ€� ranted the air at Charbagh railway station when workers arrived from various parts of the country.

A worker coming from Patna told this reporter that when Saheb was ill, the BJP-controlled official investigating agency had decided to settle scores with the former chief minister. â€œIn spite of being a lady, she was fighting the powerful Central government,â€� he said.

The workers would arrive at the Ambedkar Smark in the morning and take out a march on the thoroughfares of the city in support of behanji, said the BSP leader coming from Rohtas. â€œThis is the beginning of the protest and will continue till all the cases against her are not withdrawn,â€� he said.

The BSP workers may also gherao important government offices, but promised that this protest would be peaceful. Behanji, said another worker, never believed in any kind of violence, hence no partymen could think of indulging in arson or violence, he said. When asked whether Behanji will arrive to address the workers, they kept quiet.

15,"PCL, govt differ on Kesco’s evaluation","LUCKNOW: The state government and the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) differ in their assessment of performance of the Kanpur Electricity Supply Company (Kesco). What the government considers as non-performance is improved performance for the UPPCL.

For example, the state government cited 25 per cent low revenue collection for the period April-September by the Kesco in 2003 as compared to the corresponding period in 2002. But the figures available at the UPPCL state that revenue collected by the Kesco during April-September 2002 was Rs 168.73 crore and in the same period in 2003 was Rs 163.14 crore, down by Rs 5.59 crore.

Sources said that the government perhaps â€˜treatedâ€™ the amount paid to the UPPCL by distribution companies after meeting out their expenses as â€˜revenue realisedâ€™ and the â€˜actual revenue realisedâ€™ was not taken into consideration. It could be understood from the fact that, from April to September in 2002, the Kesco paid Rs 128.5 crore to the UPPCL and in 2003 for the same period amount paid was Rs 97 crore, which was around 25 per cent less than last year.

â€œUnlike other discoms, the Kesco has also to meet out salaries expenses of its employees and other expenditures like maintenance from the revenue realised. â€œIn September the Kesco also paid Rs 5 crore to the Power Finance Corporation as an instalment taken against a loan of around Rs 58 crore,â€� said a senior UPPCL officer.

The state government also levelled charges that the Kescoâ€™s performance was the lowest in comparison to other distribution companies. However, figures available suggest that the Kesco was placed second among discoms in the state in terms of percentage increase of revenue collection for the period of July-September, 2003.

Meerut collected Rs 452.26 crore in July-September, 2003, which was up by 8.13 per cent in comparison to the last year. Lucknow collected Rs 240.98 crore in July-September, 2003, which was up by 2.614 per cent over the last year. In the same period, Agra collected Rs 245 crore revenue, an increase of 4.081 per cent over the last year and Varanasi collected Rs 248.68 crore, an increase of 2.29 per cent over the last year.

Srivastava joined as MD Kesco in the last week of July and was removed on October 14. In July 2003, the Kesco collected Rs 30.61 crore against Rs 27.49 crore in 2002. In August 2003, revenue collection was Rs 29.18 crore against Rs 30.87 crore in 2002 and in September 2003 revenue collected was Rs 31.05 crore against Rs 26.81 crore.

A total of 3530 power connections were snapped during revenue realisation drive and 718 illegal connections were also caught during this period. If the UPPCL figures are right, Kesco MD RM Srivastava was transferred for what in the governmentâ€™s view was non-performance.

17,Sena to launch protest against massage parlours,"PUNE: Shiv Sena MLA Vinayak Nimhan on Tuesday announced that his party would soon start an agitation against massage parlours in the city if the police and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) failed to impose restrictions on them.

Speaking at a press conference at the Patrakar Bhavan on Tuesday, Nimhan said he would soon present a letter in this regard to the municipal commissioner and the police commissioner.

Nimhan alleged that several illegal operations, such as flesh trade, were taking place in the city under the guise of the massage parlours.

He added that around 150 such parlours were ruining the cultural image of the city. Such parlours were mainly prevalent in Koregaon park, Aundh, Rasta Peth, Kondhwa and Satara road areas, he said.

â€œEven if the PMC does not want to ban them, they should at least impose some restrictions on the massage parlours such as a compulsory health permit and the presence of a doctor,â€� he said. Nimhan said he would raise this question in the state assembly elections and the Sena would forcibly close down the parlours if the PMC does not act.

19,HC stays Mayawati's arrest,"LUCKNOW: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati got a breather on Wednesday when the Allahabad High Court stayed her arrest till investigations were over in the CBI cases against her.

The Lucknow Bench of the High Court asked for investigations to continue, but said there would be no arrest till these were completed.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister had on Monday filed two writ petitions seeking stay on her arrest and quashing of the FIRs in the Taj Heritage Corridor and the disproportionate assets cases.

A Division Bench comprising Justices G K Gupta and Khemkaran reserved their orders on her petitions until Wednesday after hearing at length the counsels for the defence, state and the CBI.

The Bench had also reserved its orders on two writ petitions filed by Mayawati''s former principal secretary P L Punia and former secretary (environment) V K Gupta seeking a stay on their arrest and quashing of the FIR in the Taj case.

It was urged on behalf of Mayawati that she had been ""falsely implicated"" in the cases owing to ""political vengeance"".

On the other hand, the CBI submitted that the FIRs had been lodged against the accused on the directions of the Supreme Court.

There was ample evidence against the petitioners, the CBI said pleading for dismissing of the petitions. The CBI had conducted raids at Mayawati''s residences in Lucknow, Delhi and Meerut recently.

20,SGPC general election process kickstarts,"CHANDIGARH: After the Centre notified deletion of ""sehajdhari"" Sikhs as voters in the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandak Committee (SGPC) election, the Gurdwara Election Commission here set the ball rolling for the SGPC general house elections slated for February next year.

The commission has released 40 symbols for the parties contesting the elections to pick up from. Each party could pick up three symbols, of which one would be allotted to them each.

The elections were delayed due to the controversy over the right of ""sehajdhari"" Sikhs to cast their votes in the election.

Since 1925, when the all-India Sikh Gurdwara Act came into being, the ""sehajdhari"" Sikhs had been enjoying this right.

This year about eight lakh ""sehajdhari"" Sikh voters were enrolled along with 30 lakh voters for the election. All of them would now stand deleted from the electoral rolls.

Elections to the 151-member SGPC house were scheduled to be held in 2001 when the five years'' term ended.

22,Is TDP ready for early Andhra polls?,"NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has commissioned several district-wise surveys to test whether the Naxalite assassination bid he recently survived has created a ""sympathy factor"" which could put in the shade any shortcomings in governance: If he gets a positive feedback, he could, sources said, dissolve the state Assembly by November 9 i.e. a year in advance and go for an early state election.

Party sources said no decision will be taken before the Afro-Asian Games slated for November 1. After that, he will study the opinion polls, consult his advisers and talk to the BJP leadership in Delhi.

Sources added that in case he decides to dissolve the state Assembly, he will try and push for elections by February technically, if he dissolves the Assembly in the first half of November, elections can be held any time within the next six months, i.e. April.

In recent months, the chief minister has been facing problems in the state with farmers'' indebtness leading to suicides, and opposition to the hike in state and electricity rates, not to mention the involvement of former minister Krishna Yadav in the fake stamp paper scam.

The Assembly session was marked by dharnas, demonstatrations and walkouts. And then came the assassination bid, which Naidu feels could change the tide for him.

Another reason, sources said, why he is keen to hold early elections is the Telengana question: Of the Congress''s 91 MLAs in the state, 47 are from the region where the demand for a separate state is growing stronger daily. But the Congress leadership, keeping in mind its support base in Rayalseema and coastal Andhra, does not want to endorse the idea of a separate state lest it send its voters rushing to the TDP.

So, the Congress is not too keen to have an election till it sorts out this issue or till it comes to an understanding with the Chandrashekhar Rao-led Telengana Rashtra Samiti. If the two fight separately, sources said, it would help the TDP.
