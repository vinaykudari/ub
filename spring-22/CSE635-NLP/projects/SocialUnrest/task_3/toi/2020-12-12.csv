1,Sheila sacrifices Maken at party altar,"NEW DELHI: Seven days and hectic lobbying later, the Delhi Cabinet was finally decided on Friday. A K Walia, Haroon Yusuf, Raj Kumar Chauhan and Yoganand Shastri - who figured in the council of ministers during Sheila Dikshit''s first term as CM, will be her lieutenants this time too.

Newcomers include Arvinder Singh Lovely and Mangat Ram Singhal.

The surprise omission is the youthful Ajay Maken, who was the transport and power minister in the earlier government. He has been nominated as the Congress candidate for the Speaker''s post. Ex-minister Krishna Tirath is the party nominee for deputy Speaker.

Speculation was rife that Walia would be made Speaker, while Maken and Subhash Chopra would be included in the Cabinet. In fact, Maken was expected to be given an important portfolio.

However, a late evening rethink on dropping a senior minister like Walia changed the composition.

Friday''s announcement followed closed-door meetings between Sheila Dikshit and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

According to sources, Dikshit dug her heels in when it came to Chopra. His identification with the dissident faction sealed his fate.

The composition of the ministry ensures that one representative from every major community in the city finds a place in the Congress Cabinet.

While Walia is a Punjabi, Mangat Ram Singhal is from the Vaish-Agarwal community.

Haroon Yusuf belongs to the Muslim community, Raj Kumar Chauhan represents Dalits and Arvinder Singh Lovely is a Sikh.

Yoganand Shastri is the Jat representative. Dikshit, being a woman and a Brahmin, will take care of their representation.

4,Surat industry feels it has thrived sans govt support,"SURAT: Despite epithets like â€˜diamond cityâ€™ and its core businesses having being showcased in the recently-held Vibrant Gujarat summit to rake in much moolah, Surat has not moved an inch when it comes to development.

Demanding some â€˜actionâ€™, an rather irked business community points at an array of anomalies that have been plaguing them for longâ€”a BJP MP, also a Union minister,who has failed to bring any relief, apathy from the Centre and the state in terms of providing infrastructure. And all this despite Surat being one of the highest revenue generating cities of the country, they complain in unison.

â€œOur political representation is poor,â€� laments former president of South Gujarat Chambers of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) Ripin Pachigar. â€œThe Union minister from here, Kashiram Rana, has failed to give shape to Suratâ€™s requirements despite his long term of 15 years in office,â€� he adds. Others point to the poor correlation between the volume of revenue generated and infrastructure allocations made by the state and Centre alike. The city contributes roughly Rs 5,000 crore to the public exchequer annually â€”equivalent to that by Haryana.

This includes about Rs 3,500 crore from excise duty alone, point industry bigwigs. Pointing out to the central grant for an airport in Surat, announced by Union aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudi at the Vibrant Gujarat meet, a senior SGCCI member said, â€œEven the foundation stone was laid. But not a single penny of the promised Rs 80 crore grant ever arrived.â€� Rudi had â€˜promisedâ€™ that work would begin in a weekâ€™s time, he added. Also, the proposed jewellery park continues to remain a distant dream.

What has rubbed salt to the injury is the state governmentâ€™s move to exploit the issue during its Vibrant Gujarat event where a memorandum of understanding was signed with the local gems and jewellery industry to the tune of Rs 4,500 crore. While the jewellers say they have identified land at Ichchapur for the project and are ready to pay for it, the government is delaying the allocation. Meanwhile, the vexed issue of high cost of electricity continues to plague the industry.

â€œA ten per cent relief in electricity bill was assured just before the Assembly elections last year. But, it took a back seat later,â€� says president of Federation of Gujarat Weaversâ€™ Association Manubhai Patel. â€œThe Rs 25,000-crore Textile Upgradation Fund was introduced by Kashiram Rana. But no help came the way of target weavers as they faced hurdles in procuring bank loans.

Rana even egged us on to launch an agitation against Cenvat. Later, he turned around and termed our demand as unjustified,â€� says Patel. Meanwhile, high cost of electricity has been a major hurdle as far as fresh investments are concerned, adds Pachigar. Not just the industry, citizens too are unhappy over the slow pace of development. Many point out that the net annual grant for the purpose is a meagre Rs 3 croreâ€”an amount less than the Surat Municipal Corporationâ€™s monthly electricity bill. When the former city mayor Ajay Choksi made a representation before the finance commission for complaining of the poor grant it only led to more tax on citizens, they added.

5,'UP government should do more for NCC cadets',"LUCKNOW: While NCC cadets from Uttar Pradesh are amongst the best in the country, incentives given to them by the state government are far lesser than those given to NCC cadets from other states.

The government''s apathy can be gauged from the fact that the daily food allowance sanctioned per cadet is only Rs 22, as opposed to a requirement of a minimum of Rs 40.

Disclosing these facts on Friday, Director General NCC, Lt-Gen BK Bopanna told mediapersons that the NCC teaches not only discipline, but also helps in the all-round personality development of a youth.

The government must provide incentives such as reservation in professional courses like engineering and medicine for NCC cadets, along the lines of the reservation for them in the armed forces, besides increasing the support fund, he said.

The DG is on a two-day visit to the NCC directorate of UP and Uttaranchal. The annual budget of the NCC in UP is only Rs 24 crore for a sanctioned strength of 1,34095 cadets, and this is barely enough to manage routine expenses, he said.

""An additional Rs 5 crore per annum for mess facilities and Rs 6 crore for adventure activities is needed for better management of the NCC activities in UP,"" he said.

""States like Sikkim are already providing incentives of reservation. In Pondicherry for example, there is 100 per cent government funding. The Assam government has increased the budget five-fold this year, but in UP, things have not improved,"" he said.

""I will also meet chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and request him to increase funding for the NCC in UP,"" he said.

Highlighting the importance of NCC activities, he stressed on the role that NCC cadets could play in spreading awareness about social issues.

He said even non-government organisations and others like the National Aids Control Society, can enlist the help of the NCC cadets as and when needed. ""We are already working for the Unicef,"" he said.

Lt-Gen Bopanna appreciated the support extended to HCC cadets by the Sahara India Pariwar, which this year, donated Rs 1 crore for scholarships for NCC cadets.

""While a scholarship of Rs 15,000 is being given to bright NCC cadets to pursue college studies, a scholarship of Rs 5,000 is being awarded to pursue school education, and Rs 40,000 for professional studies,"" he added.

The deputy-Director General, NCC directorate, UP and Uttaranchal, Brig RS Ranawat and other senior NCC officials were also present on the occasion.

6,Govt order on development bodies,"ALLAHABAD: The state government is all set to issue a government order on formation of a committee to look into the objections and suggestions regarding the master plan of 22 cities where development authority exists.

The GO has already been drafted and would be issued in a day or two, sources in the urban development ministry said.

The decision to this effect has been taken on December 9 in a meeting held under the chairmanship of special secretary, urban development, Ram Viriska Prasad.

It is further learnt that the GO which is binding for all the development authorities in the state has been designed to impose a check on the development authorities'' whimsical way of functioning that has an adverse effect on the civic system and infrastructural development.

It was further learnt that the GO has been approved by Prasad and was sent to secretary Jai Shankar Mishra to be signed. Sources further said that the GO would be sent to all the offices of the development authorities of the state on Friday.

The committee would send its report after pursuing objections and suggestions from the people of the respective cities along with their comments.

When contacted, divisional commissioner Dev Dutt confirmed the report of the GO. However, he added that the GO is yet to be received. ADA vice-chairman Hiramani Singh Yadav also confirmed the report.

7,March against 'incidents',"LUCKNOW: Beware Lucknowites! The ''monsters'', who outraged modesty of innocent girls at the Lucknow Mahotsav after the Awadh Samman ceremony, were not the only ones in the city.

Hundreds of them having a similar sick mindset are constantly on the ''prowl'' in the city in the ''form '' of college boys, shop-keepers, government officers, journalists, policemen and others.

Processionists, who had undertaken a march on Friday in Hazratganj to condemn the mahotsav ''incidents'', were a witness to such a depraved mindset when some onlookers passed lewd remarks and made obscene gestures.

Instead of supporting the cause, most of the onlookers remained ''insensitive'', while a few did say: ""It was real bad"". For a sizable section, the horrifying mahotsav incidents were topics of ''juicy gossips'' and ''titillation''.

As the procession reached in front of a picture hall near the GPO Park, screening an adult movie, a group of nicely dressed men in a car shouted: ""Arey bhai...why are you blocking the road...thousands of girls are molested every day in the country.""

Two police constables, standing nearby, gave a hearty laugh. One of them says: ""It (molestation) was bound to happen... the kind of scanty clothes girls wear these days..they deserved it.""

Some college students, standing in front of a restaurant near the Hazratganj crossing, said: ""Hey, what is this all about."" His friend replied: ""Don''t you remember the mahotsav incident...these people are protesting."" The first one reacted: ""Oh..that one... it was a real ''show''...""

Near the Janpath market, a shopkeeper, remarked: ""eve-Teasing is OK...but disrobing of girls is really bad... the cable culture is ruining the youth.""

When told about these reactions, former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University Roop Rekha Verma said: ""Such things are not new. We also come across such people when we stage street plays on women empowerment. There is always a group which ''enjoys'' the eve-teasing scene in the skit, instead of sympathising with the victim.""

Cases of molestation leave a mental scar on victims forever and create a fear psychosis among parents who had no option but to restrict the movement of their daughters, hampering their education and career, she said.

Sangeeta, a LU student said: ""The ''beastly'' tendencies apparently lead to sexual violence. We actually face it every day on streets, college campus and buses as well as in offices and markets. They ogle, make obscene gestures and at the first opportunity try to nudge, prick, rub against us and try to pull our clothes. Even colleagues and classmates do not hesitate in using language which has double meaning. Why do not they realise that their sisters or daughter can also be victimised in a same way.""

9,Rivers split between two ministers,"BANGALORE: Consequent to filling of two vacanies in his ministry and promoting two ministers to cabinet rank, chief minister S.M. Krishna on Friday effected a reshuffle in the portfolios of others.

A significant change has been the bifurcation of the water resources ministry with the state''s lifeline irrigation projects-Cauvery and Krishna basins - which will now be looked after by two separate ministers.

Senior minister H.K. Patil, who was in charge of water resources and is credited with introducing transparency in execution of the projects is reported to have expressed his unhappiness over the move.

The new minister for Cauvery basin is M. Shivanna and for Krishna basin Allum Veerabhadrappa.

According to sources, the water resources portfolio was split to give more importance to the irrigation projects.

However, the portfolios of senior ministers including Mallikarjun M. Kharge, Dharam Singh, K.H. Ranganath and M.Y. Ghorpode are left untouched.

The chief minister is expected to effect another reallocation of portfolios after December 25.

On Friday, Governor T.N. Chaturvedi administered the oath of office and secrecy to new entrants T.B. Jayachandra, who was Karnataka special representative in Delhi until now and Bharathinagar MLA J. Alexander, besides ministers D.B. Inamdar and Raja Amareshwar Naik.

The two vacancies were caused by the resignations of G. Raju Gowda and T. John. All the four ministers are of cabinet rank.

Jayachandra gets food and civil supplies from R. Ramalinga Reddy who will be solely in charge of Bangalore development.

Alexander has been given the high profile tourism while Inamdar following his promotion retains only information technology and biotechnology.

Information portfolio, which was with Veerabhadrappa will be handled by G. Parameshwara along with higher education.

The horticulture portfolio has changed hands from Shivanna to V.S. Koujalgi while H.M. Revanna in addition to sericulture will also be in charge of infrastructure and civil aviation.

Minor changes have been made in the portfolios of five ministers of state who hold independent charge. They are B.K. Chandrashekhar (primary and secondary education), Nafees Fazal (science and technology and KUIFDC), M. Mallikarjuna Nagappa (revenue), Baburao B. Chinchansur (small savings, lotteries, insurance and agro-processing), and M.L. Ustad (minorities welfare and Indian systems of medicine).

10,Fans mob new ministers,"BANGALORE: It was a morning of smiles, handshakes and hugs. The lush green lawns of Raj Bhavan were cold but warmth pervaded among those who had gathered.

It was an atmosphere of controlled restraint before the swearing-in ceremony, but all hell broke loose afterwards.

Unfortunately, many of the beautiful flower and plant holders were the casualty in the ensuing chaos.

The two newly-anointed ministers were mobbed by their supporters, as were the two who were elevated, but to a lesser extent. Bouquets, flower baskets, garlands of all hues and crackers were in abundance. For the hungry, Raj Bhavan provided breakfast.

However, the two new ministers were the cynosure of all eyes. Former agriculture minister T.B. Jayachandra found it difficult to hide his joy. He was dropped during the reshuffle in June last year and was upset.

To placate him, Krishna designated him Karnataka governmentâ€™s special representative in Delhi. ""I am happy to be back in the ministry. I will strive to work impartially and sincerely. My experience in Delhi should help me to competently discharge my duties,"" he said.

Former chief secretary J. Alexander, who was recently acquitted by the court in the Classik Computer case, was equally delighted.

""The CM has given me an opportunity to work and serve people better as a minister. I have 33 years of public service behind me. I will try to live up to the expectations of the CM,"" he stated.

The two ministers of state who were elevated also expressed their happiness. IT and tourism minister D.B. Inamdar was content to say, ""I am happy to be promoted,"" while prisons minister Raja Amareshwara Naik was more forthcoming.

""I am elated that the CM considered me fit for promotion to the Cabinet. I promise to discharge my duties efficiently and sincerely.""
