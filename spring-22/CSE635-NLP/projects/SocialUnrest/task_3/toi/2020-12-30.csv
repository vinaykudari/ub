1,"Wanna party, then get a woman driver first","NEW DELHI: It''s time men took a lesson of social responsibility from women. Smashing the myth that women are the unsteady ones behind the wheel are the facts that the traffic police stands by.

In the last three weeks 676 people have been prosecuted for drunk driving in the city. None of them, however, was a woman so far.

What is alarming, however, is that about 30 to 40 per cent of those prosecuted were below the age of 25, the legal age of drinking.

Traffic officials admit that no excise department officials participate in their drives against drunk driving to trace the source of alcohol for these youngsters.

According to officials, no minors have been caught tipsy on the road though.

While the number of drunks on two-wheelers stood at 437, the number of car owners caught drunk was 170.

The remaining 69 include auto rickshaw, bus and truck drivers.

""A sizable number of those prosecuted for drunk driving were under 25 years ,"" said deputy commissioner of police (traffic - New Delhi Range) Arun Kampani.

These under-age merry makers, who do not hesitate before pushing the accelerator and heading for a joyride, are issued just the regular court challan under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicle Act.

""We can''t take any other action against them. It does not come under our jurisdiction,"" informed a traffic official.

Drunken driving is a ""court offence.""

The offender is ""arrested"" but let off on a bail bond that is filled on the spot.

The person has to appear in court the next day asa result of such an offence.

The vehicle''s registration papers and the person''s driving licence too are confiscated and produced in the court.

In case a person is ""too drunk to drive"" the vehicle is impounded and the person is then detained till a friend or relative arrives to take the vehicle and escort the person home safely.

Last year seven people died in road accidents on New Year''s eve due to drunken driving.

Let us hope that 2004 comes in on a better note.

3,Overseas Peaceniks say Gujarat riots disturbing,"AHMEDABAD: Even as foreign delegates attending the International Conference on World Peace (ICWP) deliberated on various aspects of peace on Tuesday, they wondered why there was no attempt to probe the reasons behind the communal flare-ups in Gujarat.

â€œI am surprised why there was no reflection after the riots over the differences that came to surface in the name of religion. There also seems to be absence of efforts to highlight ethnic commonalties to mitigate the communal tension in the state,â€� said a delegate from the UK, Paul Fletcher.

He said it was disturbing to learn that Gujarat, which is constitutionally part of a secular socialist state, was prone to communal clashes. Incidentally, the title of the paper that Fletcher presented with co-author C Ram Prasad on Tuesday was, â€˜Is the reconciliation of religion and politics the way to peace?â€™.

Another delegate from the US, Joseph Runzo admitted that there was some apprehension among his team members before coming to Gujarat for the conference.

â€œSome of my colleagues did not want to be typecast as being on â€˜being this side or thatâ€™, so they did not join us. Some others did want to know if it was safe to travel to Gujarat, he said, adding, â€œpersonally, I prefer to visit a disturbed region myself, instead of simply theorising on what might have gone wrong there.â€�

Runzo presented a paper on, â€˜War and soul of humanity in a global worldâ€™. He said peace efforts should concentrate on underlining commonalties between different communities.

â€œThere should be an effort to delve into the realities underneath the calm exterior, as there is a tendency among people to fall back on the peace efforts after conflict passes off.

His wife Nancy Martin, who presented a paper on, â€˜Imaging global peace â€” a role for Hindu saintsâ€™, said that she was disturbed by what had transpired in Gujarat, but did not hesitate coming here.

â€œI have been working in India for some time, and my impression of her, is one of a peaceful country with a rich traditional value system. So I was disturbed when I heard about the disturbances in Gujarat,where in some instances, neighbours attacked each other. However, I was not in the least bit apprehensive about coming here to attend the conference,â€� Martin said.

A delegate from Israel, Phyllis Herman said she was not deterred from coming to the state, in the wake of reports about violence here last year.

â€œIt was, however, ironic to see all those gun-toting men guarding the delegates during the inaugural session, considering it is a world conference on peace,â€� Herman quipped. Her paper was on the topic, â€˜The body of goddess.. generating hope for peaceâ€™.

In order, that the state does not witness a repeat of last year, dialogue between communities should be facilitated, feels, Christopher Key Chapple, a delegate from the US,who presented a paper on, â€˜Teaching religion and ecology in a university contextâ€™.

â€œI think if we want the next century to be peaceful, such conferences will have to be held,â€� Chapple said.

5,Advani indicates early LS polls,"MUMBAI: Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani indicated here on Tuesday that the Lok Sabha elections could be advanced to late April or early May.

The NDA stood to gain from the victories in the recent assembly polls, the feel-good factor in the economy and the â€œabsence of a formidable oppositionâ€�, he said, adding the BJP leadership felt the Congress and its allies would not be able to pose a major challenge.

â€˜â€˜The general assessment is that the NDA can be reasonably confident of renewing its mandate for five years,â€™â€™ he told a press conference after a meeting with Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray.

The December round of assembly elections had created an upbeat mood in the BJP and the NDA about the LS polls, as it was generally felt the poll outcome would affect the results in other states too, he said. â€œThe economic situation has also created a feel-good factor. If these two reasons are combined, then it looks early elections can be good, but the pros and cons have to be seen and a decision will be taken only after due deliberations with BJPâ€™s allies.â€™â€™

Driven by the best monsoon in a decade and buoyed by strong growth in farm, factory and services output, the Indian economy is expected to see 7 per cent economic growth in the fiscal year ending in March 2004. A final decision on polls, he said, would be taken only after consulting all the NDA constituents before the BJPâ€™s national executive meeting in Hyderabad on January 11 and 12.

Thackeray concurred with Advaniâ€™s views, saying his party was in favour of holding early polls. â€˜â€˜Advanijiâ€™s views are my views,â€™â€™ he said.

The meeting between Advani and Thackeray was originally scheduled at the latterâ€™s home but was shifted to the mayorâ€™s bungalow at Shivaji Park. Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi arrived at the sea-side residence minutes before the arrival of Thackeray. No other Sena leader was allowed in. Later, Advani was escorted to the venue by BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan.

Advani and Thackeray were alone for the better part of the 40-minute meeting. Joshi and Mahajan spent some time at the lawns and were summoned in later.

Advani played down DMKâ€™s drifting away from the ruling coalition and withdrawal of its members from the Union government. He said the party had already ended its association with the BJP in Tamil Nadu. Therefore, its reaction was â€˜â€˜not unexpected.â€™â€™

On Vajpayeeâ€™s security during his visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit in the wake of recent attacks on president Pervez Musharraf, the Deputy PM said the Pakistan government would do what was needed.

Thackeray kept silent for the most part of the press conference. Asked for his views on the Saarc meeting, Thackeray, known for his hard stance on Pakistan, cryptically replied: â€˜â€˜Had I been the prime minister, things would have been different.â€�

6,Petrol stations remain closed to protest killing,"PATNA: All the petrol stations in the city remained closed on Tuesday in protest against the killing of Pramod Kumar Mishra, the owner of three petrol stations. Mishra was killed on Monday in the Gandhi Maidan area while on way to a State Bank branch to deposit a cash amount of Rs 10 lakh.

The strike was called by the Bihar Petrol Dealers Association and the Patna Petrol Dealers Association. Most of the petrol pump owners of Patna had gathered at the Bailey Road Super Service Station near the Patna High Court on Tuesday morning to decide their future course of action.

Speaking to media persons, some of them voiced their distress at the poor law and order condition in the state.

Brijendra Kumar Sinha, secretary, Patna Petroleum Dealers Association, said that petrol dealers have become soft targets for criminals. They are being looted, kidnapped and killed in regularity for the last few years. Mishra was killed in broad daylight in the heart of Patna that too near the residence of the DM and the SSP''s office. ""There was no firing by policemen who were witness to the incident. This shows the level to which the moral of the police has gone down in Patna,"" he said.

Rajeshwar Narayan Agarwal, president, Bihar Petroleum Dealers Association (BPDA), said that the association has decided to give four days'' time to the government to arrest the culprits, failing which they would be forced to go on an indefinite strike.

""It is very difficult for us to continue with our services in the prevailing environment of fear. We have already faced enough. The ''rangadars'' create problems for us quite often. Most of them flee without paying the bills. Some show us weapons when asked for money,"" said Suneel Kumar Sinha of IBP Auto Service.

Rajiv Mouar, the proprietor of a petrol station on Bailey Road, said that the dealers should be provided security so that they could work in a fearless environment.

Shailendra Singh, vice president, BPDA, said that in the last five years nearly 35 petrol pump dealers have been killed in Bihar besides a number of driveway salesmen.

He said that the government is doing nothing to provide security to the business community. ""We don''t even get arms licence easily so that we could protect ourselves,"" he said and added that facilities should be made for the safe delivery of the traders'' money to the banks for which an escort team comprising of administration and police officials should be made available.

A nurse, however, could not escape and was assaulted. By then, the doors leading to the upper floors were locked up.

Doctors from the hostel came down to take on the rampaging mob. A team from the Entally police station reached the hospital and stopped the fight, but not before some of the doctors had been beaten up. Three of the outsiders were detained.

â€œOne of them had sustained injuries. A broken glass pane had pierced his leg. He has been taken to the Chittaranjan Hospital,â€� an officer said. The hospital superintendent B. Khan said the girl had been admitted in time but there was nothing to be done.

Junior doctors assembled at the emergency gate and refused to allow the media to enter the hospital building. TV cameras were pushed away. The police had to intervene again to prevent a showdown.

The cabinet dismissed the allegations against the chief ministerâ€™s family as ""utterly baseless, malicious and motivated"" and a part of the design to tarnish the image of the Congress party in general and the chief minister in particular.
