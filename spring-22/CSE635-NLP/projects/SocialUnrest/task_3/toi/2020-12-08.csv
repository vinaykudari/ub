1,'Encounter' triggers riots in Ghaziabad,"GHAZIABAD: Massoori and Dhaulana residents took to the streets, blocking the Massoori-Gulaoti highway and damaging vehicles from 8 am to 12.30 pm on Monday morning. The riot was said to be sparked by the alleged â€˜â€˜killing of three innocent menâ€™â€™ in an â€˜â€˜encounterâ€™â€™ in Massoori.

Later, Dhaulana residents protesting against the custodial death of a local leader, Bir Singh, on Saturday joined the rioting. Deputy police chief V K Shekhar, however, said the encounter took place after the police chased three men who ran away after robbing a godown in Hapur.

2,Corporates must work with govt: Kalpana Kar,"BANGALORE: Corporate houses need to play a bigger role in moulding and mentoring youth of the new millennium, experts participating in the World Youth Peace Summit said on Monday.

The corporate sector can play a major role in the countryâ€™s economic development and it needs to work in tandem with the government to bring about progress. This was BATF member Kalpana Karâ€™s suggestion during a panel discussion on the role of corporate sector in moulding and mentoring youth.

Harsh Neotia, managing director of Ambuja Cement Eastern, felt that the corporate sectorâ€™s primary responsibility is to ensure its own success, which in turn contributes to progress. Retired IAS officer K.J. Alphonse differed, saying corporates have a social responsibility that extends beyond their own success.

Earlier, the need for voluntary organisations to pay more attention to children was emphasised by panelists at a session on juvenile delinquency.

A call was made for more commitment from all sections of society to safeguard the rights of children who are the supreme assets of the nation.

In the last session, over 1,500 youth leaders who gathered for the summit, got a glimpse of the nationâ€™s healthcare potential and a talk on the dangers of various forms of addiction.

Cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty said that India is set to be the largest healthcare provider in the world by 2006. Collective efforts like health insurance and technology initiatives like telemedicine will break the barrier of affordability in the country, he felt.

The summit, organised by the International Association of Human Values in association with Times Foundation, will end on Tuesday after sessions on entertainment, the environment, media, and peace.

3,Chemists plan 2-day statewide bandh,"MYSORE: The Mysore District Chemists and Druggists Association has decided to observe a bandh on Wednesday and Thursday.

On both these days, chemists and druggists shops will be shut throughout the state. Mysore District Chemists and Druggists Association president K.B. Shivaram and secretary Narendra Babu complained that authorities at Drug Control were creating trouble for them in the name of increasing their efficiency.

In a press release, they alleged that the state drug controller had issued a notification stipulating targets for registration of cases against chemists and druggists.

They also alleged that drug controller had warned of action against those who failed to reach the target. Due to this, local authorities were creating problems for chemists and druggists and were inspecting premises just to register cases, they complained.

The department was also sullying image of chemists and druggists by projecting them in a bad light, they alleged adding that they were forced to register protest by shutting down their operations on both days.

Global reading programme: Students and faculty of the Mysore Public School joined a global reading programme by reading for 2004 seconds (33.4 minutes) at the school premises. The event was organised by Scholastic India. About 75 students who are away in Port Blair on an educational tour also joined the event.

4,"Thirsty days ahead, cautions minister","BANGALORE: With the failure of north-east monsoon, Karnataka will face â€œwater famineâ€™â€™ from March to May, rural water supply minister K.B. Koliwad said.

Koliwad said here on Monday: â€œThe situation will be worse than last year. Drinking water storage is 50% below normal and groundwater is depleting.â€™â€™

In some taluks of Kolar, Tumkur and Belgaum, the position was already â€œvery seriousâ€™â€™ and water was being transported through tankers. â€œAs the water storage level is very poor and the monsoon has failed, the government has taken total control over groundwater, which accounts for 90 per cent of our drinking water sources.â€™â€™

Quoting a Cabinet note, Koliwad said: â€œThe Cabinet is concerned that the underground water situation in the entire state is very critical. It was the unanimous opinion of the Cabinet to initiate measures to rejuvenate water bodies.â€™â€™

A decision was taken to educate farmers on the groundwater position and request them not to take up high/ medium irrigation crops. A government order has been issued asking them to use irrigation tanks only for drinking water.

With the state getting Presidential assent for the Karnataka Groundwater (regulation for protection of sources of drinking water) Act (1999), all sources of water (including private ones) will be requisitioned to provide drinking water. Anyone who wishes to drill a borewell within 500 metre of a drinking water source has to get permission from the DC.

Meanwhile, chief secretary B.S. Patil said district in-charge secretaries had been asked to draw up a six-month action plan on drought. â€œWithin 15 days, we will release Rs 100 crore of the crop insurance due to farmers, to help them tide over immediate distress,â€™â€™ he added.

5,Dakor crude bomb case prime accused arrested,"VADODARA: The Anand police have nabbed two prime accused in the case related to making crude bombs in a house in Dakor. They are believed to be the kingpin of a gang that had allegedly planned to attack the rath yatra in Dakor last year in retaliation of the communal riots.

Six persons have already been arrested in the case taking the tally of arrested persons to eight. Following a tip-off, the Umreth police arrested prime accused Mehmoodmia along with Ayesha Qureshi from the house of Hussainabibi Qureshi at Dakor in Anand district. The accused have been charged under section 120, 201, 34 of the IPC and under section 908, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Explosives Act.

The two were produced in court and have been remanded to 14 days police custody. According to the police, the plan to attack the rath yatra had come to light after a crude bomb went off in a house at Dakor on July 7 last year. The accused had been given medical treatment at SSG Hospital in Vadodara.

At that point, they had told the police that a gas cylinder had burst in the house which injured them. However, FSL reports had confirmed that the explosion had taken place while the persons where trying to manufacture crude bombs. The officials had found explosives residue from the house. Six of the accused identified as Yusuf Qureshi, Nisar Qureshi, Altaf Vora, Altaf Qureshi, Imran Abdul Malik and Yunus Vora were arrested last year.

6,Old City calm on bandh day,"HYDERABAD: The Old City remained peaceful on Monday although rumours kept the residents on edge in some localities.

While a bandh called by the BJP passed off peacefully, indefinite curfew remained in force in eight police station limits following the communal riots of Saturday that left five persons dead and over 25 injured.

Mild tension was reported late on Monday from two localities of Santoshnagar following incidents of stone throwing at a religious place and a bid to demolish a boundary wall of a community hall.

Police discounted rumours of stone-throwing and police firing in the air in Madannapet and Shahalibanda police station limits late Sunday night.

As many as 214 history-sheeters were detained as a precautionary measure, home minister T Devender Goud told reporters at Charminar before visiting the riot-hit areas on Monday evening. The situation will be reviewed and a decision on relaxing the curfew will be taken on Tuesday, he said.

7,"Naidu's brother joins Cong, in-law to follow","HYDERABAD: Causing some embarrassment to his elder brother Chandrababu Naidu, Nara Ramamurthy Naidu on Monday formally joined the Congress in the presence of Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi. Naidu Jr met the Congress president at her Parliament Annexe office and expressed his desire to work for the party.

And in a double whammy for the chief minister, his brother-in-law Daggubati Venkateswara Rao is reportedly about to join the Congress, probably next week. Rao aided Chandrababu Naidu in dethroning N T Rama Rao, but later severed ties with him.

TDP sources said both Ramamurthy Naidu and Venkateshwara Rao are spent forces and command little influence in electoral politics. But the Congress camp is jubilant, hopeful that these developments will cause some discomfiture to Chandrababu Naidu.

Top TDP sources said Chandrababu Naiduâ€™s mother attempted to bring about a rapprochement between the brothers and even persuaded Ramamurthy to rush to his elder brotherâ€™s side the day the latter escaped an assassination attempt by the naxalites. But with the chief minister reportedly unhappy with the younger Naiduâ€™s recent utterances in the media, Ramamurthy turned to the Congress.

Naidu Jr, according to sources, wrested the promise of an election ticket from Congress leaders before meeting Sonia Gandhi. He is banking on getting the Congress ticket from the same constituency. But Congress leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy last week assured Aruna that she would get the seat.

Congress sources said Venkateswara Rao might be fielded from Bapatla for the Lok Sabha.

8,Ex-deputy superintendent of city stamp office arrested,"MUMBAI:Retired deputy superintendent of the Mumbai stamp office Babanrao Ranjane was on Monday arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) for his alleged role in the stamp paper scam.

Ranjane was summoned to Mumbai from Pune for questioning at the SIT office in Worli. He will be produced before the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court in Pune on Tuesday afternoon.

Police sources said that Ranjane was suspected to have helped scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi by mixing fake stamp papers with original stamp papers distributed through authorised vendors.

Stamp papers are distributed to the vendors by the stamp office. The SIT also wants to confirm the allegations that Ranjane had a role to play in deliberately showing a shortage of supply in stamp papers.

Telgiâ€™s marketing agents had then camped outside the stamp office near the Town Hall in the Fort area and sold fake stamp papers at a premium.

Ranjane, who retired from the stamp office in February last year, is the first official from the stamp office to be arrested in the scam. The police are also probing the role of four former superintendents of the stamp office. All of them are IAS officers and have been questioned by the SIT in the past. They include a former secretary to a chief minister in Maharashtra and a current deputy secretary at Mantralaya.

An SIT statement said that the four were questioned as they had failed to take action against Telgi, whose accomplices were caught selling fake stamp papers in the Fort area between 1995 and 1998.

Earlier, former Pune assistant police commissioner M.C. Mulani, who was in judicial custody, was produced before a court in Pune on Monday and was remanded to police custody till December 16.

Meanwhile, suspended police inspector K.K. Parmar was arrested by the Mumbai unit of SIT on Monday night for his alleged connivance in the fake stamp paper scam. Parmar was attached to the Colaba police station in 1995 when he allegedly went soft on the probe against Telgi.

Parmar was last attached to the airport unit of the Crime Branch when he was suspended a few months ago. He was booked under the Indian Penal Code and the police will find out his nexus with Telgi before seeking to bring him under the purview of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.

9,"Greenpeace activists fined, face arrest now","MUMBAI: Eleven Greenpeace activists aboard the Rainbow Warrior will miss their flights back home because they have not been allowed to disembark from the vessel at Ferry Wharf here.

The reason being given is that the campaigners had violated their visa conditions by campaigning against toxic ships when they came on tourist visas. The captain, Cosmo Wassenaar, also had to fork out Rs 1 lakh as penalty to the Bhavnagar customs on Friday for entering Alang port precincts without permission and taking photographs.

The campaigners are on board the Rainbow Warrior, which docked at Mumbai on Sunday. â€œWe paid the penalty under protest because our charts did not not show the outer limits of Alang port,â€™â€™ Captain Cosmo Wassenaar said.

The campaigners have to return to their countries in Europe. But the police have posted armed guards who will arrest any activist who disembarks from the vessel, Captain Wassenar said.

â€œWe came to help the Indians because ships carrying toxic substances were being sent here to be broken up. There have been several explosions while cutting up these end-of-life vessels. How can we be treated like this ?â€™â€™ asked Ms Evedien Tulliers, a campaigner.

On one hand, the Indians are seeking our help in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to fight against dumping of toxic waste. â€œOn the other hand,we are being hounded because we have been clearly told by the police that our vessel has to go to another country for the campaigners to fly out,â€™â€™ the activists told TNN.

Rainbow Warrior was adrift at sea for 28 days before being allowed to dock in Mumbai after paying the fine of Rs 1 lakh. â€œWe have alerted our activists in 40 countries. They will send telegrams to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee deputy PM L.K.Advani and others. This will become an international issue,â€™â€™ the activists said.

10,SP holds unity rally for north Indians,"MUMBAI: Shiv Senaâ€™s on-going stir against north Indians has evoked a sharp reaction from the Samajwadi Party and a nod of approval from the Sharad Pawar-led NCP.

The Mumbai unit of the Samajwadi Party on Sunday held a rally in Malad to display the â€œunityâ€™â€™ of north Indians in the face of the Senaâ€™s stir to secure reservation of jobs for the local youth.

The SPâ€™s national general secretary Amar Singh, who flew down to Mumbai to address the partyâ€™s lagaam rally, sought an apology from the Sena for having â€œhumiliatedâ€™â€™ the Biharis and UPites.

â€œThe 55 fly-overs,which the Sena boasts as its â€˜achievementâ€™, came up in Mumbai because of the hard work put in by north Indian migrant workers,â€™â€™ Mr Singh said.

â€œMaharashtra is the karma-bhoomi of north Indians. What kind of Hindu Hridaya Samrat Mr Bal Thackeray is when Shiv Sainiks are going berserk and beating up Hindus from other states?â€™â€™ he asked. Another query which Mr Singh hurled at Mr Thackeray was: â€œIs Bihar or UP a part of Pakistan that the Sena is treating north Indians in this fashion?â€™â€™

Samajwadi Partyâ€™s Mumbai unit president Abu Asim Azmi vowed to â€œbreak the handâ€™â€™ that is raised against people from other states.

Stating that the jobless Bihari youth who the Shiv Sainiks are targetting are Indians, Mr Azmi said, â€œPeople from our own country should not be subjected to discrimination and humiliation.â€™â€™

Meanwhile, NCP activists from Thane, led by former corporator Pratap Sarnaik, held demonstrations near a newly-constructed multiplex theatre on Monday to demand that a fair share of jobs in the theatre should be set aside for the local youth.

â€œWe came to know that the cinema hall management had offered jobs to â€˜outsidersâ€™ so we decided to act. The proprietor has agreed to set aside 90 per cent jobs to the Thane youth,â€™â€™ said Mr Sarnaik.

Asked if the NCP had taken a cue from the Sena, Mr Sarnaik retorted, â€œThe Sena doesnâ€™t have proprietorial rights over sons-of-thesoil agendaâ€™â€™.

An ECR official said that keeping in view the bandh, all the five divisions of the ECR have been put on alert. Special security squads will be deployed in the long distance mail and express trains either originating or passing through the ECR divisions.

15,NDA seeks Rabri govt's head,"PATNA: An eight-member NDA delegation, led by its state convenor Nand Kishore Yadav, on Monday submitted a memorandum to governor M Rama Jois demanding immediate dismissal of Rabri Devi government for its alleged anti-national activities.

Accusing the Rabri Devi government of patronising RJD MP from Siwan Mohammad Shahabuddin, despite his alleged links with ISI and international gangs of criminals, the NDA delegation requested the governor to direct the government to make public the 100-page report submitted by former DGP D P Ojha regarding Shahabuddin''s criminal and anti-national activities. Yadav told the TNN that the governor had assured the delegation that he would look into the matter and take appropriate decision.

The memorandum said that Bihar had emerged as an ISI den in the regime of the RJD which was evident from the fact that Rahman Gilani, an accused in the attack on Parliament is a native of Biharsharif, Nalanda, while Shamim Sarwar, a key accused in the attack on US embassy, is a native of Phulwarisharif, Patna. It said that Fasim Raja, the main accused of Godhara carnage, also hails from Phulwarisharif while Farhan Mallick alias Aftab Ansari, the main accused in the attack on US Information Centre, Kolkata, had got his passport on the recommendation of the then DSP of Nalanda district.

The workers of NDA constituents, including BJP and JD(U), on Monday took out ""mashal julus"" in all the districts in protest against the removal of Ojha. The NDA has given call for Bihar bandh on Tuesday.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly Sushil Kumar Modi, who was away in Assam on a sadbhavna mission, would be reaching Patna on Tuesday to participate in the bandh. The memorandum said that the unity and integrity of the country would be in jeopardy if the Rabri government was allowed to continue any longer. The memorandum further said that firearms recovered by the police from Pratappur (Siwan) residence of Shahabuddin after the Pratappur incident allegedly bore the seal of Lashkar-e-Toiba.

(LeT). But, the government, in an apparent bid to hush up the case, handed over its investigation to the CID and transferred the then Siwan SP along with officers-in-charge of 18 police stations.

The NDA delegation said that the Central Intelligence Agency had written four letters to the government since 1997 alerting it about ISI activities in the state. Former DGP V P Jain had also drawn the attention of the state government towards it in 1994, the delegation informed the governor. In 1995, it said, the customs department had arrested some Afghani terrorists at Birpur in Supaul district and a case was lodged in this connection with the Birpur police station. It again arrested some Afghani terrorists at Birpur in 1998 and lodged two case with the Birpur police station in this connection, the memorandum stated.

The NDA delegation said that Ojha was removed because he was trying to establish rule of law in the state. The memorandum also said that law and order had collapsed in Bihar and kidnapping for ransom had taken the form of a thriving industry. Apart from it, Bihar had recorded unprecedented increase in the number of murder, rape and loot during the past few years, it added.

17,Ex-envoy arrested for torturing 'bahu',"PATNA: The police on Monday arrested former Congress MP, former ambassador to Laos and well known journalist Gauri Shankar Rajhans and his brother-in-law Pramil Kumar Mishra in a dowry torture case under Section 498A of the IPC.

In an FIR, Manikant Thakur, a journalist with the BBC, named Rajhans and his wife Hema Rajhans as accused in a dowry harassment case. Thakur alleged that his daughter Aparna Thakur, who is married to their son, Punit Rajhans, was being tortured by the Rajhans family for dowry.

Thakur has also named Rajhansâ€™ brother-in-law Pramil Kumar Mishra and sisters-in-law Savita Mishra and Nima Mishra in the FIR.

Thakur further alleged in the FIR that all the five accused had tried to drag and forcibly take away Aparna from New Republic Hotel here.

On the basis of Thakurâ€™s statement, the Patna DM and the senior SP rushed to New Republic Hotel on Exhibition Road from where all the accused managed to escape. The police then raided Manprabha Apartment on Boring Canal Road and arrested Rajhans and Pramil.

They were kept in Gandhi Maidan police station till late on Monday evening.

However, Rajhans alleged that the FIR was fabricated and that Thakur had an eye over a good chunk of his property in Delhi and that he was being blackmailed.

He said that there was no question of torturing Aparna in the name of dowry as they had given her jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh in marriage.

After two months of her marriage, Aparna returned to Patna along with his father, he said, adding, â€œShe even took the jewellery with her. I am ready to go to jail but once I am out I will expose Thakur.â€�

Rajhans said that as an MP he had urged former PM Rajiv Gandhi to incorporate Section 498A in the IPC. â€œOnce I am out of the jail, I will struggle for the scrapping of Section 498A,â€� he said.

Rajhans claimed that he was trapped by his daughter-in-law who asked him to come to Patna and talk to her. â€œWhen I reached the hotel, I was trapped,â€� he added.

Thakur, on the other hand, said that his son-in-law Punit behaved violently with Aparna. He said that he had even asked Rajhans to see to it that both Aparna and Punit were separated.

â€œBut Rajhans assured me that his son will not ill-treat Aparna,â€� he added.

Thakur had brought Aparna from her in-lawsâ€™ house six months back. The marriage was performed in Patna in April. He alleged that Aparnaâ€™s in-laws had kept all her belongings, including ornaments.

He said that Rajhans and his family members wanted to take Aparna to Delhi so that they could force her to give a statement in their favour.

18,'Hawker zones' may draw protests,"PUNE: In a bid to free the main city thoroughfares and busy chowks of hawkers and vendors, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has planned a major programme to re-settle them in the official â€œhawkersâ€™ zonesâ€�.

The civic administration has identified as many as 49 such zones to rehabilitate 1,525 hawkers and vendors. Most of these zones are in Aundh, Bibvewadi, Dhankawadi and Shivajinagar areas. The move to rehabilitate hawkers and vendors in such a large-scale in suburban areas is likely to trigger off protests from local shop owners and residents.

To pre-empt such an eventuality, the administration on Monday issued a public notification, inviting suggestions and objections to the proposal from residents, shop owners, voluntary organisations and institutions. The suggestions and objections should reach the PMC within the next 15 days. As per the proposal, of the 49 zones, 31 have been planned on roadside plots, while 18 on natural nallahs, which will be covered with slabs. Although the PMC has said that the slab-laying will not block the flow of water, not all the nallahs are owned by the civic body.

Many pass via private and government properties. The civic officials, hence, anticipate protests from these property owners. Each hawker/vendor will be allotted a 4 sq. ft. by 5 sq. ft. (20 sq. ft.) area in the zone. A senior municipal officer told TNN that the PMC will seek an affidavit from the hawkers and vendors that they will stop doing business along the main city roads after their resettlement. A similar undertaking will also be sought from their unions.

Asked if hawkers and vendors from other unions would start business on the roads, the officer said: â€œIn such cases, we will not spare them and heavy penalties will be imposed.â€� In fact, in a separate public notification, the municipal corporation has threatened to lodge criminal offences against such hawkers and vendors. The municipal administration has also warned garage owners against parking their nonfunctional vehicles along the city roads. It has threatened to confiscate such vehicles and scrap/auction them.

19,Sonia was party to split plan: Khunte,"RAIPUR: Controversial Lok Sabha MP P.R. Khunte on Monday admitted that he acted as the linkman between Ajit Jogi and BJP leader Virendra Pandey to engineer a split in the BJP legislature party to form a rebels-led government with Congress support.

And this plan, he claimed, had the sanction of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. At a press conference here, Khunte said Jogi had told Pandey and BJPâ€™s MP from Bastar, Baliram Kashyap, that the plan had Soniaâ€™s sanction and that he had initiated the move only after talking to her as the party was in the interest of installing a tribal as CM. Khunte appeared before the media for the first time after the cash-for-MLA sting operation by the BJP.

An emotionally charged Khunte narrated the sequence of events and said, â€˜â€˜Someone had leaked it out, otherwise the operation could have been successful.â€™â€™ Khunte, however, claimed that he had told both Jogi and Pandey to give up the idea as it was against the democratic traditions. Pandey is a BJP defector. He also gave a clean chit to Amit Jogi, son of the former chief minister.

He said that when he visited Ajit Jogiâ€™s house twice for talks on the issue, Amit was not present. Kashyap, who was said to be ready to take over as the CM with support from Congress legislators, was angry with the BJP leadership over distribution of tickets. He had to be airlifted by Narendra Modi to Delhi. He softened after a meeting with the PM.

According to Khunte, a helicopter was sent to Jagdalpur to bring Kashyap to Raipur for further negotiations. Pandey, he said, was asked by Jogi to bring in 17 BJP legislators for formation of a Congress-supported government. And Jogiâ€™s demand for the legislators was made after his talks with Sonia, Khunte claimed.

20,"Show-cause to IG, govt pores over CBI note","PATNA: The state government has started a damage-control exercise in view of the defiant posture adopted by D P Ojha after his removal from the post of DGP.

It is learnt to be contemplating severe action against him for violation of the service code of conduct by making anti-government remarks. A show-cause has already been served to Ojha for this while the State Commission for Women has summoned Ojha to explain his statement that chief minister Rabri Devi was â€œgoongiâ€� (dumb).

The government is also looking afresh into the CBIâ€™s 1996 recommendation for departmental proceeding against him for his role in the fodder scam.

â€œIf Ojha fails to give his reply within seven days to the notice on violation of the service code of conduct, he would face the music,â€� a senior government official said.

According to police sources, Muzaffarpur IG Yashwant Melhotra, who has prepared the former DGPâ€™s much-trumpeted 100-page report on RJD MP Shahabuddinâ€™s alleged ISI links, was on Monday summoned to Patna. State home commissioner B K Haldar and new DGP W H Khan discussed the contents of the report with the IG.

The sources said when Malhotra was asked for evidence to substantiate the contents, Malhotra pleaded he had prepared the report on the basis of material provided by the headquarters. The 100-page report is based mostly on the statements given to the police of various places by arrested criminals, the sources said.

Malhotra has also been asked to show cause as to how could he have knowledge about the correspondence between the government and the DGP. The show-cause specifically refers to a letter written to the then DGP Ojha by the home department on August 1, 2003.

21,New power policy to 'electrify' scene,"LUCKNOW: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday announced a new power policy in the Assembly with special emphasis on fresh investment, encouragement to augmentation of environment-friendly generation and optimum utilisation of existing energy resources through modernisation and renovation of units.

The government, however, pledged to provide power to cent per cent villages in the state by the 2009. Unveiling the new policy in the House, the chief minister said that the state would provide an interest free loan of an amount equivalent to the entry tax and the trade tax, due and payable during the construction period and for a period of seven years from the date of commencement of operations.

Yadav said that after taking into consideration all relevant factors, government felt that the policy needed a fresh look. On account of a huge debt of Rs 33,000 crore in this sector, it was essential to make heavy investments to the tune of Rs 21,000 crore, the chief minister said. The chief minister admitted that 44,000 villages still do not have power.

â€œAlthough an annual outlay of Rs 800 crore is required for a cent per cent village connectivity, the government is committed to complete village electrification on a priority,â€� the chief minister said. The chief minister said that the government would encourage private participation in transmission so as to attract necessary investment for strengthening and expansion of the system.

The government, he said, would strive hard to provide a minimum of 14 hours of power to the rural areas. For this, the government would seek Central assistance, he said. The new policy envisages that sale of power only to the state utility, necessary transmission lines and substations would be done by the state. Or else, the generating company would be allowed to create the same and necessary support for it would be extended by the government.

Commenting on the new policy, Leader of the Opposition Lalji Tandon said that he was not opposed to it in principle but was quite skeptical about the outcome. Recalling his own decision in this regard, Tandon, who has held the charge of power minister in the past, said he was the first to experiment it in NOIDA and then in the Vishnu Prayag scheme. However, neither proved to be beneficial for the government, he added.

22,New Haj rules stir a hornet's nest,"KANPUR: The changes in the Haj package by the Central Haj Committee this year at the instance of Central government is causing a lot of consternation among the members of the community in the state, which sends approximately 70,000 for the pilgrimage annually. The Central Haj Committee has brought drastic changes in the Haj plan by introducing several new measures.

The most prominent of the new set of regulations states that all the income tax-payee pilgrims travelling for the first time will have to fly from the state capital, whereas those making a second or third visit will have to fly from Delhi. Now there is a catch here. According to the Shariyat (Muslim law), no woman can go for Haj all alone and a man must accompany her.

The men for whom it is not the first Haj visit and an accompanying lady who is making her first trip, the regulation is nothing less than a curse. They will not be able to fly out as according to the Muslim law, they will have to fly separately which is also not permitted, rued a local community leader. Haj committee states that the rule was sketched to reduce pressure from the state capitals. It was increasingly becoming difficult to guarantee timely flight for the pilgrims due to rush. Now diversion of those who have already accomplished Haj at some time, will ensure a hassle-free pilgrimage to many on maiden visit.

Another grudge of the community is that the unexpected withdrawal of Haj subsidy has put an extra burden on the pockets of income tax-payee Haj pilgrims. The subsidy has been withdrawn for the pilgrims who are income tax-payee or have already made a trip. Altogether 46,000 Haj pilgrims have been charged an additional Rs 20,000. Now the cost of a Haj trip for an income tax-payee has hence risen upto Rs 35,000 whereas for non-income tax-payees, the total cost is approximately Rs 12,000. Agitated over the new rules, the community has already sent memos to the President and the Prime Minister.

Community members, under the leadership of city kazi Kaari Abdus Sami recently staged a demonstration at the gates of Haj Training Centre in Bansmandi. Sami, speaking to Times News Network, said: â€œCentral government is treating the community as an â€˜stepâ€™ sect in the Country.

Atleast the state government should look into the matter and provide us with some relief.â€� Speaking on the issue of subsidy, he said: â€œLet the subsidy be withdrawn, but we should be given freedom to deal directly with the flight operators so that we can avail discounts.â€�

23,Pay the fine and break the rules,"NEW DELHI: Shell out Rs 500 and party till you drop. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on Tuesday dropped even the pretension of following the law by ordering that weddings and parties held in farmhouses should be allowed to continue after paying the necessary fine.

Standing committee chairman Ram Babu Sharma said, â€˜â€˜People are being harassed by the civic agencies and the police. We should allow them to celebrate as they have no other option.â€™â€™

Farmhouses and banquet halls are not allowed to be used for commercial activities, but during the wedding season and towards the year-end, they are heavily booked for parties. The MCD directive may be music to the ears of the party-hoppers, for local residents it spells doom. Whether it is traffic snarls, â€˜â€˜mobile barsâ€™â€™ and the subsequent drunken brawls, residents of Vasant Vihar, Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli-Gurgaon road face a growing menace.

â€˜â€˜Generators run through the night and so plays the wedding orchestra. There has been no respite since October because there are four or five weddings every night,â€™â€™ said Pawan Puri, who lives close to the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road.

Green Avenue resident Ashwini Khurana said, â€˜â€˜Generator fumes, loud music and fights are a daily feature. Some times it takes me an hour to cover half a km if I get caught in a wedding procession.â€™â€™

The mayhem continues despite the Delhi High Court order that bars wedding processions from certain roads, like MG Road, or Delhi chief secretaryâ€™s order that forbids government officials from attending parties hosted at farmhouses.

The restrictions seem to have done little to dampen the party spirit. And Banquet hall owners are having a field day. â€˜â€˜We have two lawns with a capacity of 500 and 1,000 people respectively and they have been booked two months in advance. We donâ€™t have an opening till January,â€™â€™ a banquet hall owner said.
