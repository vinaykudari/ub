0,1 held for using AK-47 during Dariapur riots,"AHMEDABAD: The Dariapur police on Monday arrested one Imtiaz Noormohammad Shaikh alias Chiko allegedly for using an AK-47 during the riots. However, the AK-47 is yet to be recovered.

The incident, say police sources, is of April 14 when rioting was at its peak in the city. During a communal strife in Dariapur and Kalupur areas, a local videographer is said to have videotaped a peculiarly dubious activity.

The videotape, which is now in possession of the city police, shows two persons running up the flight of stairs of Shabnam Apartments in Balucha Wad of the ''sensitive'' Dariapur area.

Additional commissioner of police (Sector II) Satish Varma said: ""The arrest was in connection with a case that was filed on the basis of evidence provided through this videotape.""

Sources, however, told TNN that the accused was sticking to his statement that he was not one of the two shadowy figures seen at the apartment carrying AK-47. Shaikh claims that he was not present in Dariapur on April 14. He has, however, identified one of the two persons seen at Shabnam Apartments.

Shaikh has pointed towards one Mohammad Rauf who the city police are now on the look out for arrest.

Shaikh and Rauf are accused of firing bullets from rooftops while rioting was on in full swing in the Dariapur and Kalupur areas.

According to police sources, Shaikh was injured in police firing and was then treated at a private hospital in the Gomtipur area. ""This injury, however, was not reported to the police. Ever since he has been staying in the Juhapura area. And that''s where he was arrested from,"" said sources.

Shaikh''s arrest was effected after the Dariapur police picked up the owners of Shabnam Apartments who later pointed towards Shaikh as one of the two figures shown in the videotape.

""One of the two, in the video tape, was carrying a gun that looks strikingly like an AK-47. Shaikh has been picked up based on the looks that we could decipher from the videotape. We are investigating this case in detail,"" said Raju Rathod, a senior police inspector at Dariapur police station.

2,Heated exchanges delays riot probe panel hearing,"AHMEDABAD: Heated exchanges between Justice G T Nanavati - chairman of the Justice Nanavati and Justice Shah Commission of Inquiry in to Godhra and aftermath - and advocate S H Kureshi resulted in the postponement of the commission''s proceedings till Wednesday.

The commission will decide Kureshi''s application regarding examining the witnesses on oath rather than as simple statements. The hearings will resume after this was decided.

On Monday, the commission had summoned PSI Mehmud Baig, who was on duty at Godhra when the incident happened. He had prepared the inquests and panchamas of the 58 bodies recovered from the burnt coach S-6 of Sabarmati Express.

The deposition of the witness was over and cross-examination was permitted by the commission. Advocate SH Kureshi then objected to the reliance on the statements recorded by the police. He said he was not interested in participating in the proceedings of the commission if it wanted to conduct inquiry only on the basis of the police statements.

The commission then said this was not the case and witnesses were being examined. This would also help it decide whether the statements and affidavits by them were true or not.

Following arguments and altercations, Kureshi repeated that he was unwilling to participate. He was then asked to leave the proceedings immediately, if he wished.

Kureshi said he did not come to the commission on his own, but was invited to participate. To this, commission chairman Justice Nanavati said that his invitation stood cancelled.

Justice Nanavati then decided to terminate further hearing and cross-examination of the witnesses for the moment.

Meanwhile, during his examination and cross-examination, Baig stated that he was not at Godhra when the incident occurred. He said he was in Vadodara at his headquarters, and came to know about the incident only at 9.15 am. He left for Godhra at 9.30 am and reached the spot at 11.15 am.

He said after 12.40 pm, when the Sabaramti Express finally left for Vadodara, a mob of some 3,000 persons came to the site. They were shouting ""Chhod do"", ""maar dalo"", ""kaat dalo"" (leave them, kill them, cut them) and started pelting stones.

Baig recollected that the floor of the coach got burnt more, and there was no other smell except that of fire. He admitted that there was no panchanama done for the luggage which was thrown out of the coach while removing bodies.

3,IPS aid for riot-hit policemen,"AHMEDABAD: Hirabhai Parmar (36) stared death in the face and lives to tell a horrifying tale. On February 28, when Gujarat was gripped by the three-month-long communal strife, Parmar - a traffic policeman - was mobbed near Danilimda area.

Parmar managed to stagger out, despite his 13 stab injuries, after playing dead till the mob turned its attention towards other victims. His near-miraculous recovery cost him Rs 13,000.

It is here, that the police top-brass, 116 IPS officers of the state, stepped in to rescue. Contributing from their own salaries each of the IPS officers have reached out to all those policemen who died or were grievously injured during the recent communal riots.

""Till date we have distributed approximately Rs 5 lakh among the affected policemen or the nearest of kin. Parmar has been given Rs 18,000 of which Rs 8,750 is as fixed deposit in his name. This welfare scheme is specially meant for those policemen in Ahmedabad who died during riots"", said additional commissioner of police (administration and headquarters) Keshav Kumar. Kumar is the implementing authority of this police welfare scheme.

Sureshrao Chauhan, a policeman of Bharuch, was among the beneficiaries to receive a sum of Rs 50,000 on Monday. Chauhan''s son, Amar, was killed on duty during the recent riots. Amar, a constable posted at Gomtipur area, was stabbed to death by an irate mob on April 21.

Among the beneficiaries was assistant sub-inspector of Kalupur police station, Chhatrasinh Narsinh Dabi, who had died of an heart attack on May 28. He was on duty then. His wife Kuwarben, had come all the way from Kapadwanj taluka to receive the welfare-donation of Rs 50,000 and appeal for her son''s employment.

""In all these cases the motive has been to stand by the policemen and help their families in such trying times. Donations made by IPS officers are apart from the sum that the kin of deceased and the injured will get from the state government. This is a small gesture of solidarity"", said Kumar.

4,Bhawna blames CM for her arrest,"LUCKNOW: â€œI have been framed in a criminal case at the instance of chief minister Mayawati as she feared that I was here to topple her government,â€� this was a confidant Bhawna Pandey talking to reporters after she appeared at the district court on Monday where she was remanded to a 48-hour police custody.

Adopting a softer tone for the excise commissioner AK Gupta, Bhawna said that he was just made an scapegoat and she had nothing against him. â€œHe is like the proverbial sacrificial lamb,â€� Bhawna said as she walked out of the court room in police custody. Clarifying that she had no grudge against anyone, Bhawna said that she had her cards close to her chest and would open them at the opportune time. She said that Chief Minister Mayawati appeared to have been misinformed about her presence in the state capital and, hence, all this drama.

5,BSP rally in city on Sep 28,"LUCKNOW: The Bahujan Samaj Party will organise a â€˜maharallyâ€™ to be addressed by deputy prime minister LK Advani and BSP president Kanshi Ram on September 28 to give a befitting reply to the detractors of Dalits, including the Samajwadi Party and others. The maharally will be held at Ambedkar maidan, adjacent to Lucknow jail, on the outskirts of the city.

Talking to mediapersons, BSP vice-president Mayawati on Monday said that a couple of BJP state leaders, including urban development minister Lalji Tandon and president Vinay Katiyar, would be invited for the rally, though it would be purely a show of the BSP. Mayawati said that the Samajwadi Partyâ€™s observation that the Ambedkar Smarak was a place for merry-making was â€œshamefulâ€�. The Congress Party, she said, by maintaining a silence on it, dittoed the Samajwadi Partyâ€™s line, which was an insult to Dalits, who would never tolerate this kind of â€œinsultâ€�.

Asked for her reaction to the Union agriculture ministerâ€™s criticism of the coordination committee, Mayawati dismissed it saying Ajit Singh had not been posted with the facts on it by his men. She said that the meeting of coordination committee could be called any time if there was need for it.

Cabinet expansion: Chief minister Mayawati said that she would expand her cabinet by the end of this month. She said that the exact date for the expansion of her ministry would be announced after the end of current session of the Vidhan Sabha.

6,Corruption charges levelled against revenue minister,"LUCKNOW: Revenue minister Ravi Gautam came under fire in the Assembly on Monday when Ram Govind Chaudhry of the SJP levelled charges of corruption against him and blamed him for amending the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act for his vested interests. While moving his cut motion, Chaudhry said that the bill put up by the minister for the amendment in the act should be referred to the select committee of the House because it was essentially done by the minister to serve his own interest.

He said that the biggest beneficiary of the amendment in the act would be the minister himself as this way he would legalise his possession on several acres of land in and around the prime location of NOIDA and Ghaziabad. In support of his contention, Chaudhry also began to read out from various documents, allegedly forged by the minister in his favour. He further claimed that the minister had pocketed compensation for a vast chunk of land by manipulating the records in his favour. He also handed over the said documents to the Chair and pressed for an inquiry into the scam, if the minister dared to challenge him.

The minister was caught on the wrong foot when he chose to rebut the charges by saying that he came from a well-to-do family and inherited over 500 bighas of land. â€œLet me clear further that my name is Tara Chand alias Ravi Gautam and the compensation in lieu of my land would be given to me and not to Ram Govind Chaudhry,â€� the minister said. The ministerâ€™s reply provoked a fresh fireworks, as Chaudhry sought to know from him how could he own so much land in gross violation of the Land Ceiling Act. The question, however, drew a blank from the minister. However, though the minister said that he was prepared to face any consequences if found guilty, presiding officer Waqar Ahamad did not make any inquiry order. The bill was later passed with a voice vote by the House.

Mata Prasad Pandey of the Samajwadi Party pleaded that the amendment in the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act was uncalled for. Under the provisions of the amendments, all possessions on land belonging to the gram samaj till May 1, 2002, by those belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be regularised. Pandeyâ€™s main objections were based on his apprehensions that, firstly, the provisions of the amendments would be misused for illegal encroachments which would create a law and order problem in villages and, secondly, the power of giving land patta should be vested with an officer of the level of SDM and not with tehsildar.

7,City govt to have own legislation on Metro operations,"NEW DELHI: Even as it decided to bring a separate legislation in Delhi assembly on operation and maintenance of Delhi Metro Rail, the Delhi state government on Monday tried to diffuse tensions with the Centre over inauguration of the Shahdara-Tis Hazari rail corridor in December.

The Delhi cabinet has decided to invite President A P J Kalam to inaugurate the first corridor of Metro Rail. While the Union railway ministry wanted Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to inaugurate the first rail run, the Delhi government had been pushing for Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

On Monday, the state cabinet settled on a neutral name, that of the President. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit would formally invite the President and the date of inauguration would be fixed on his convenience.

However, the polemics on who would control operations of Metro rail continued with the state government deciding to bring a separate legislation in Delhi assembly. The Union ministry of urban affairs has already drafted the Delhi Metro Railways Operation and Maintenance Bill 2002.

Delhi state transport minister Ajay Maken said the Centreâ€™s Bill has excluded the state government from the responsibilities of running the Metro Rail. He said: â€˜â€˜The Metro Rail should be managed by the Delhi state government as it directly relates to the lives of Delhiites. Our stakes in the Metro Rail project are same as the Union governmentâ€™s. We are both paying 15 per cent each of the total cost. So there is no reason why we should not operate the rail.â€™â€™

Maken said to pay up the loan taken from the Japanese Bank, which is 70 per cent of the project cost, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will depend on its earnings from the Metro Rail operations. â€˜â€˜Since the residents of Delhi would end up paying the maximum share for construction of Metro, involvement of state government in the project is important,â€™â€™ he said.

The state government would, however, have to seek the Union governmentâ€™s approval before bringing the Bill in Delhi assembly. â€˜â€˜We would request the Centre to only decide on aspects concerning safety, accident claims, appointment of claims commissioner and deciding on the technical parameters for operation of Metro Rail,â€™â€™ Maken said. Maken said his government wanted to have the final word in functions like fixing metro rail fare, finalisation of rail corridors and day-to-day operations of the Metro Rail.

The Delhi cabinet, on Monday, criticised the Union governmentâ€™s contention that the Metro Rail is a part of Railways and a Union subject. Maken said once its operational, Delhi metro would be part of the inter-city traffic. â€˜â€˜The constitution says all modes of transport operating within the state are subject to state governmentâ€™s control. Delhi Metro should be operated by the state governmentâ€™â€™ he said.

10,2 BKI militants arrested,"AMRITSAR: The Tarn Taran police arrested two militants of the Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and recovered explosives, which were to be used for disrupting the assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir and also for targeting certain mediapersons, politicians and retired police personnel.

Stating this here on Monday, director general of police M S Bhullar said the two BKI activists were arrested near Sarhali, on Sunday, while they were travelling in jeep which was intercepted by the police.

The arrested militants were identified as Sukhwinder Singh and Gurmail Singh, both residents of Kapurthala district.

The DGP said on search of the vehicle, 14 packets of PETN explosives, four digital detonators, Cordex wire, four mechanical detonators, four electronic timers and one Echolac trans-receiver were recovered.

The Echolac trans-receiver, of Japanese make, has the capability of triggering off two blasts at the same time through a remote control from a distance of five km.

Bhullar claimed that it was found out on interrogating the arrested militants that this consignment was to be used for triggering off explosions in J and K areas adjoining Punjab.

Certain mediapersons, politicians and retired police officials were also on their target list, he claimed without disclosing names.

The DGP said this consignment had been smuggled through the Ajnala sector of Punjab by one Narinder Singh, brother of Gurmail Singh, one of the militants who was arrested about one-and-a-half years ago. Narinder Singh, along with another militant Gurdial Singh, who had assisted in the smuggling operation and had concealed the consignment, is currently under detention.

It was on the instructions of BKI Pakistan-based chief Wadhwa Singh that the concealed consignment was recovered by the two arrested militants and was being transported to an area close to the J and K border when it was intercepted, he claimed.

Bhullar said this latest plan of the BKI was being executed under the directions of the ISI.

He claimed that the Punjab militants based in Pakistan were under exceeding pressure to carry out terrorists activities in India. Bhullar said that Wadhwa Singhâ€™s name was also on the list of militants which was handed over to Pakistan after the December 13 terrorist strike on Parliament.

11,Youth commits suicide in Baranagar,"KOLKATA: Failing to shrug off the â€˜peeping Tomâ€™ stigma and the fear of being â€˜disownedâ€™ by his own family, a youth committed suicide at his home at Jhulantala, Baranagar, in the northern fringe of Kolkata on Sunday night. The anger it generated saw the locals go on the rampage and assault the hostel authorities.

Two supervisors and two inmates of the hostel were arrested on the charge of abetment to suicide. Police sources informed that Debashis Mondal, 21, of Nandalal Dey Road was beaten up by several boarders of a working womenâ€™s hostel on August 24 for allegedly peeping into it from his adjoining residence.

Locals said that on August 25, two hostel supervisors went to Debashisâ€™s father, Basudeb Mondal, and forced him to give a written undertaking that his son would not do so in future. Subsequently, Debashis, a fish vendor at the local market, fled from home.He returned home on Sunday night only to be threatened by the hostel inmates that he would be beaten up, if he did not leave the locality. He was also rebuked by his father. Debashis later committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of his house.

Baranagar police, however, said, neither any inmate nor the hostel owners lodged a complaint with the police and that Debashisâ€™ father had not given any undertaking. â€œThe boy did not have a past record of teasing women,â€� informed SDPO, Belghoria.

Meanwhile, the arrest of law clerk Abhijit Kundu as a Naxalite â€œsuspectâ€� has created a stir in the legal fraternity. â€œIt is a grim signal to us that we should not even dare to defend legally those who are accused by the state,â€� comments senior advocate Asit Ganguly.

Advocate Kunal Mutsuddi of Alipore court, whose assistant Kundu was, has filed a writ petition (WPM 12688 of 2002) before the Calcutta High Court.

12,Opp asks govt to expose Karnataka,"HYDERABAD: Cutting across party lines, all major political parties in the state on Sunday endorsed the steps taken by the state government with regard to the situation arising out of Karnatakaâ€™s opposition to the Telugu Ganga project and the Srisailam left bank canal. An all-party meeting held on Sunday deplored the Karnataka government for having sought a direction from the Supreme Court, and for having prayed to direct Andhra Pradesh to stop the construction of works on these two projects.

The Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxists), Telangana Rashtra Samiti, Telugu Desam Party, Bharatiya Janata Party and the MIM leaders appreciated the stand taken by the government that Karnataka should stop work on the Upper Tunga and four other projects. They felt that Karnataka was going ahead with large-scale irrigation projects and was investing huge sums of money without obtaining statutory clearances from the central government.

The leaders said that Karnataka had no right to ask the Andhra Pradesh government to stop the ongoing works which did not violate the Bachawat agreement.

Leaders of all the parties urged the state government to expose the dual stand of the Karnataka government.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu told the leaders that the issue would come up before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The chief minister said he would convene another meeting next week to apprise them of the outcome and review the situation.

The all-party meeting, convened by state irrigation minister K Srihari, was attended by P Govardhan Reddy (Cong), K Laxman (BJP), B V Raghavulu (CPM) and K Chandrasekhar Rao (TRS).

13,Punjab farmers seeks relief from debt,"LUDHIANA: Thousands of farmers from various parts of the state, on Monday, converged at Chattar Singh Park here on a call given by as many as five leading farmersâ€™ organisations demanding relief from the ever-increasing burden of debt.

Led by Kirti Kisan Union (All India Mazdoor Sabha), Bharti Kisan Union Ekta), All India Kirti Kisan Sabha, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha and Khetibari and Kisan Vikas Front, the farmers, including women, raised slogans against the central and state governments for failing to address their problems which had become worse during the on-going drought.

Farmer leaders criticised the government for playing the blame game to score political points instead of taking concrete steps to grant relief to the farming community which was being crushed by the debt.

Speaker after speaker harped on the apathetic attitude of respective governments. Demonstrators responded with equal fervour by shouting slogans. The gathering showed no signs of dispersal even as it rained heavily towards the end of the massive rally.

The speakers demanded declaring Punjab as drought-hit without delay. As a long-term measure, they demanded immediate steps for recharging the declining water level in the state.

The farmers raised the demand of granting compensation at the rate of Rs 15,000 per acre to those who had to plough their paddy fields and Rs 12,000 to those whose land was left unsown.

The government should announce relief on the standing crop on account of escalated costs at the rate of Rs 5,000 per acre, they said.

They also raised the demand for crop assessment prior to harvesting and the same should be done in the name of the farmer concerned in addition to providing diesel at half rate.

Alluding to the government move of reimposing power tariff, the union leaders urged the government to ensure regular power supply and water, particularly for the marginal farmers. They also demanded waiving of loans from government and private financial institutions and framing new policy to facilitate loans at four per cent rate of interest.

Threatening to intensify the stir if the government failed to meet their demands, the leaders said under the proposed joint action plan, they would organise demonstrations at respective district headquarters from September 16.

16,HC seeks details about govt move on land consolidation,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Monday allowed 10 daysâ€™ time to government advocate S D Yadav to apprise the court of the matter relating to the decision of the state government on land consolidation in the light of the note sent to it by secretary-cum-commissioner of revenue and land reforms K A H Subramanium.

An order to this effect was passed by a division bench, comprising of Chief Justice R S Dhavan and Justice R N Prasad, after hearing the parties, including petitioner, Krishak Sangathan, which had filed a PIL in this connection.

Land consolidation in the state remained suspended for more than a decade. When Subramanium took over charge of the department he sent a note to the state government stating therein the utility of the land consolidation scheme, which is beneficial specially for small and marginal farmers. Besides, it is the constitutional obligation of the state government to complete the scheme, as the same is related to Schedule 12 read with 243-G of the Constitution. A supplementary counter-affidavit to that effect had been filed by Subramanium in the HC stating the full facts.

19,Brahmeshwar Singh’s arrest tilts balance,"GAYA: The fragile peace in the killing fields of the Magadh region which has not witnessed any major carnage since June 16, 2000 when 35 Dalits and backward caste people were gunned down by the Ranvir Sena squad is attributed to what is perceived as the balance of terror in the region. This balance of terror appeared after Ranvir Senaâ€™s emergence as a major player in the bullet game.

After Brahmeshwar Singhâ€™s arrest, that balance of terror is now gone and it is advantage Naxalites. In any case the Sena was sufficiently weakened after the killing of Chunnu Sharma in the Jehanabad district more than a year back and the arrest of Punnu Sharma, another Ranvir Sena frontliner who was arrested by the Gaya police a few weeks back. To add to the Senaâ€™s discomfiture, land owners belonging to a particular social group now feel disenchanted on account of the extortionist methods employed by the Sainiks against their own patrons.

First it was Chunnu Sharma who allegedly demanded heavy protection money from the transporters operating on the Patna-Gaya route. Following the reservations shown by the transporters to meet Chunnuâ€™s demand, a blanket ban order was promulgated by an infuriated Chunnu disrupting traffic for several days. Subsequently the transporters, most of them belonging to the caste whose interest the Sena claimed to serve, went in appeal to the Sena supremo who promptly removed Chunnu as the Gaya district leader of the armed outfit and nominated Satendra Sharma in his place. The transporters reportedly argued that in any case they were making contribution to the Sena fund voluntarily and the protection money demanded by Chunnu was an avoidable burden.

A few months later Chunnu was killed in a police encounter in the neighbouring Jehanabad district. The Sena in the Magadh region was never the same again after Chunnuâ€™s death in a police encounter.

If Chunnuâ€™s killing was not enough to break the Sena back in the Magadh division, Punnu Sharma, alleged to be one of the most daredevil operators leading the Sena adventures from the front, fell into the police net again, on account of internal betrayal.

A section of big landowners went against Punnu as the latter allegedly started sending demand notes for personal aggrandisement to those, who in any case were more than sympathetic to the Sena, and provided all kinds of support to the Sena. The balance of terror has now undoubtedly tilted in favour of the Naxalites.

20,SC asks Shah to challenge refusal of charge modification,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday gave liberty to film financier Bharat Shah, accused of having links with underworld and threatening cine star to act in certain movies, to challenge the refusal of the trial court to modify charges framed against him.

A Bench comprising Justice M B Shah and Justice D M Dharmadhikari, gave this liberty to Shah while hearing his petition challenging the Bombay High Court order refusing to quash the charges framed against him and others.

Shah''s counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, had pointed out that the High Court had after appreciating the evidence ruled that the accused could move the trial court for modification of charges.

Sibal contended that there was not a shred of evidence, even prima facie, to suggest that Shah at any point of time had threatened to murder the film stars and said the framing of murder charges against him was absurd.

The apex Court adjourned the petition filed by Shah challenging the High Court order for two weeks to give time to the petitioner to appeal against the refusal of the trial court to modify the charges.

The High Court on June 26 had rejected Shah''s plea for quashing the framing of charges against him by the designated court set up under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

22,Maharashtra govt rejects IDBI's offer for DPC power,"MUMBAI: Hopes of an early restart of Enron''s idle Dabhol power plant have been dashed with the Maharashtra government rejecting an offer by IDBI-led lenders for resuming purchase of power at a new rate saying it was ""unacceptable"".

The offer of IDBI-led lenders to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for power purchase at Rs 2.86 per unit of the Project''s phase-one was ''unacceptable'' and the rate should be reduced to an acceptable level, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh told reporters here on Monday night after presiding over a meeting of leaders of the ruling Democratic Front.

The government is expected to communicate its decision to the financial institutions later on Tuesday.

Deshmukh said the government would like to discuss further reduction in the proposed tariff.

""We are making efforts to reduce DPC''s tariff to a reasonable level. However, IDBI''s condition of pass-through tariff to MSEB is unacceptable,"" he said, adding that the DF leaders were of the opinion that naphtha rates should be equivalent to that of coal instead of international crude oil prices.

The leaders also said that the Centre should waive its minimum alternate tax. IDBI, which has quoted 13.5% as its interest rates, should bring it to 10% in view of the downslide in global market and that it should repay loans of all foreign lenders who have extended financial assistance to the ambitious power project.

24,BJP strike protesting power tarrif hike on Sep 6,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As part of its move to intensify the ongoing agitation demanding rollback of power tariff hike, the BJP state unit has decided to observe a 12-hour statewide hartal on September 6, the party''s state president, C K Padmanabhan said here Tuesday.

BJP activists would picket before the secretariat for a week from September 9 and in other centres, including KSEB offices, he said.

While asking all sections of people to participate in the hartal, Padmanabhan also wanted the policemen to take part in the dawn-to-dusk hartal.

Padmanabhan said BJP wanted the hartal to be peaceful and did not approve of damaging public properties in the name of agitation. BJP cadres had been given strict instructions not to indulge in violence and destruction of public properties, he said.

However, the peaceful manner of agitation should not be construed as a weakness of the party and the chief minister should shed his stubborness and withdraw the power hike, he said.

Padmanabhan said it was understood that a proposal for reforms in KSEB without increasing the charges has been approved by the cabinet and government should implement that decision.

To a question, he said functioning and financial position of KSEB could be improved by collecting the arrears amounting to crores of rupees and by preventing transmission losses and theft.

25,PM holds Cabinet meet on disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Tuesday held a high-level meeting with his Cabinet collegues on various matters including disinvestment and some security-related issues.

The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, Defence Minister George Fernandes and Finance Minister Jaswant Singh, who denied there was any ""tussle"" among ministers on disinvestment process.

""We discussed many topics including economic policy, foreign policy, some security-related matters and also disinvestment,"" Singh told reporters after the meeting.

He, however, declined to give details of the discussions.

Asked if the Fernandes'' objections to the disinvestment process came up at today''s meeting, he said, ""the matter would be taken up at an appropriate occassion.""

He added that reports relating to differences on disinvestment policy and process were more in the media than in reality.

On whether the upcoming meeting of Cabinet Commitee on Disinvestment (CCD) would see a consensus on disinvestment of Hindutsan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), he said it would be unfair to guess the outcome of the meeting.

Singh denied that there was any tussle between the cabinet ministers over the disinvestment process adding that ministers spoke on various matters. He said other matters which came up for discussion included UTI bail-out package and its outcome and also Industrial Finance Corporation (IFCI).

The BJP had on Monday come out in support of Disinvestment Policy but stated it was for the ''collective wisdom'' of the Government to decide as to which PSUs should be taken for privatisation, and with what methodology.

The BJP''s comments assumed importance in the wake of Defense Minister and Samata Party President George Fernandes suggesting on Sunday that there should be a discussion of small group of Ministers to review disinvestment policy.

In the middle of the controversy over privatisation of the oil PSUs the scheduled meeting of CCD was deferred for the fourth time on August 27 and is now likely to be held on Saturday next.

28,Good turnout likely in J&K polls: Fernandes,"NEW DELHI: Even as the Hurriyat Conference launched an anti-election campaign in Jammu and Kashmir, defence minister George Fernandes said on Tuesday that the government had made â€˜â€˜all possible arrangementsâ€™â€™ to ensure â€˜â€˜free and fairâ€™â€™ polls and expected a â€˜â€˜good turnoutâ€™â€™ in them.

Any attempt to disrupt the polls from across-the-border or from within will be â€˜â€˜nipped in the budâ€™â€™, warned Fernandes.

â€˜â€˜All the protection the security forces can provide will be there for candidates, voters and election officials,â€™â€™ he said.

â€˜â€˜Kashmiris are steeped in politics and know the significance of their votes. We should expect a good turn-out since they are aware of the significance of these elections,â€™â€™ said Fernandes, on the sidelines of a function to lay the foundation stone of a new building for the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.

Referring to last yearâ€™s panchayat elections in the state, Fernandes said though militants had killed some candidates and voters, the voting percentage had been as high as 85 to 90 per cent.

Asked about his meeting on Sunday with Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah, Fernandes said he had been meeting Kashmiri leaders for several years now.

The minister said Shah had told him that he stood for democracy without any reservations and wanted an end to the violence in the state.

Shah also said that the Kashmiri Pandits would have to return to J&K as soon as possible since the state was not a full entity without them.

During the meeting, Shah apparently made no mention of his unhappiness at the refusal of Prime Minister Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani to meet him.

31,Mother attempts suicide after trying to kill children,"AHMEDABAD: A mother of three attempted to kill herself and her children on Tuesday afternoon at their shanty in Manilal Mathurji ni chali of the Bapunagar area.

All the four - Kailashben Shankarlal Solanki (38), Ripal (11), Umesh (8) and Dharmesh (5) - were admitted at the Shardaben Municipal Hospital with 90 per cent burns.

Late in the evening Umesh succumbed to his injuries. The rest are also stated to be in a critical condition.

Primary investigations carried out by the senior police inspector of Bapunagar area, N K Barot, suggest that the suicide bid was caused by constant bickering between the victim and her spouse.

Around 1.30 pm, the neighbours on hearing cries of pain rushed out of their houses to see smoke coming out of Solankis'' residence. Local residents broke open the door, doused the flames and rushed the four to hospital.

Pawanji Kanjibhai, uncle of Shankarlal Solanki, who stays in the same neighbourhood said: ""It is a shock for us. I cannot figure out why Kailashben would take such an extreme step.""

Police investigating this case however could get more out of one of the victims who was in position to talk. Little Rimple recounted how it all happened.

Rimple, in her statement, has said that her parents often fought over trivial issues. That her mother was keeping unwell and could not go for work.

Rimple''s father Shankarlal, who is a daily wage earner, was himself struggling hard for the upkeep of his family. His neighbours believe that for Solanki, getting contractual-labour jobs was becoming increasingly difficult staying in riot-torn Bapunagar area.

On Tuesday the couple had yet another argument and Shankarlal left for his hometown - Mota Mowada in Dehgam taluka of Gandhinagar district - in a huff.

Rimple recalls that her mother suddenly locked the doors of their house. Kailashben then proceeded to douse her three children and herself with kerosene before striking a match.

Bapunagar police which is investigating the case is however waiting for her mother to regain consciousness for a detailed report on the incident. ""Rimple was having difficulty in speaking and we will need to have an adult who was present there on record. We are also waiting for Shankarlal to return"", said police.

34,Govt puts FFW on hold; minister denies move,"HYDERABAD: Strong reactions from the opposition on collection of development charges by the APTransco and irregularities in the â€˜Food for Workâ€™(FFW) programme have forced the government to do a rethink.

According to sources, during the cabinet meeting on Monday, a senior minister referred to the widespread opposition to the collection of development charges and its adverse impact on the ruling party.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu concurred with the ministerâ€™s observation and agreed to keep the collection of development charges in abeyance until further notice.

Transco had collected approximately Rs 33 crore as development charges from consumers.

Allegations of irregularities in FFW programme and shortage of rice for the programme were also discussed at the meeting. The cabinet decided to delay the implementation of the FFW for some time.

However, information minister S Chandramohan Reddy denied that the programme would be kept in abeyance.

35,UTI may be govt adviser for PACL divestment,"CHANDIGARH: UTI Bank is likely to be appointed by Punjab government as adviser for the disinvestment of Punjab Alkalies and Chemicals Limited (PACL) â€œThe inter-departmental committee on disinvestment had short listed three companies in its meeting on Monday and UTI Bank was finally selected out of the three,â€� principal secretary industries, Mukul Joshi told Times News Network. Now the decision of this committee will be put before the core group of secretaries, headed by the chief secretary, that is meeting on Wednesday to take a final decision in the matter. Nine companies had been invited to make presentations on Monday, out of which eight turned up. Of these eight, three were short listed after the presentations. These were PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PWC), Deloite and UTI Bank. Finally UTI bank was given the nod. â€œUTI Bank has been involved with the disinvestment process with the Government of India (GoI) and they are working on two projects for the GoI and are mandated for a third one,â€� a member of the committee told Times News Network. One being asked why PWC and Deloite, which have far more experience in disinvestment consulting worldwide, the officer replied, â€œPWC has no experience with the Government of India.â€� The decision, that had a hint of controversy over the issue of transparency in the selection process, was defended by the member of the committee, who said, â€œIt is not mandatory to disclose the technical criteria to companies that made the presentation as it makes lobbying more intense.â€�

In fact the non-disclosure of selection criteria was a sore point with the companies that made the presentations. â€œWe were not told about the criteria on which the selections were made,â€� Ravi Arora, deputy general manager (DGM) of the industrial finance corporation of India (IFCI), the person who made the presentation on behalf of IFCI told Times News Network.

â€œWe were told that only three companies have been short listed after the presentations had been made,â€� he said when asked whether he enquired from the committee members about the criteria on which the selection was made. Other players who made the presentations included Alliance Securities, Karvey consultants and a joint venture between Dara Shaw and Grand-Thronton, a merchant banker. A similar complaint was echoed by representatives of other companies. â€œIt is like an examination. If you donâ€™t know what marks are given for which question and whether there is negative marking, how can you hope to do well?â€� another company representative said.

â€œI donâ€™t know whether we were supposed to disclose the criteria to these people, but if anyone has a complaint he/she can tell us about it. In any case the criteria were purely objective and were applied uniformly to all the companies,â€� Joshi said in response to why the technical criteria on selection were not disclosed to the companies beforehand.

37,George wins Round 1 on disinvestment,"NEW DELHI: Defence Minister George Fernandes had his way on Tuesday when the Cabinet Committee on Security met informally and discussed, among other issues, the security aspect of oil PSU disinvestment as well as how to prevent the creation of monopolies ahead of the crucial September 7 meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment.

At Tuesdayâ€™s meeting, sources said, finance minister Jaswant Singh virtually backed Fernandes both on the security aspect as well as on his concern that disinvestment should not lead to the creation of monopolies.

This was an indirect reference to speculation that HPCL and BPCL â€” whose fate will be discussed at the September 7 CCD meeting â€” may also be sold to Reliance, which has already bought IPCL.

Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, sources said, while agreeing that the security aspect must be addressed, made two points: One, that the disinvestment of HPCL and BPCL should not take on a Fernandes versus Arun Shourie turn, just as the VSNL disinvestment had been seen as a Pramod Mahajan versus Shourie fight; and two, that the disinvestment ministry must explore options other than the one being considered.

The PM, sources later revealed, said very little but heard all three men out. He is reportedly keen that there should be a â€˜â€˜consensusâ€™â€™ on this issue.
