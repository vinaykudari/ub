1,Admn goes all-out to make farmer's bhog a flop show,"BATHINDA: BKU-Ekta (Ugrah) group leaders are trying their best to mobilise as many farmers as they can for the bhog ceremony of Gurdev Singh, who was killed after being hit by a train during a rail roko agitation by farmers near Bhai Bakhtaur village.

The district administration, on the other hand, is leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that the bhog ceremony, intended to mount pressure on the government, turns out to be a flop show.

The bhog is scheduled for October 10 at Gurdev''s village, Maur Charat Singh Wala.

As a pre-emptive move, the administration is trying to strike a compromise with the Ugrah group. It is also using coercive methods to see to it that the bhog ceremony is not well-attended.

If the administration succeeds in its move, the BKU will be prevented from giving a call for a further agitation.

To appease the kisan leaders, the police have released some of the arrested leaders in the last two days.

However, the police are still raiding the houses of some kisan leaders to make sure that they are not able to mobilise farmers for the bhog ceremony.

Apart from the administration, a group of BKU leaders is also not interested in making a grand show of strength during the bhog ceremony, sources said.

Reason: The group had agreed to settle for a compromise with the administration immediately after the death of the farmer and the lathicharge incident.

However, leaders of the Ugrah group had declined to accept the compromise formula as they wanted to carry on with the agitation.

So, an impressive gathering of farmers at the bhog ceremony is expected to indirectly benefit the Ugrah group.

While the leaders of other farmers'' organisations are planning to announce the next agitation on October 10, the Ugrah group has already started holding meetings of BKU members in rural area to mobilise them in large numbers for the bhog.

As members of the Ugrah group were the ones injured in the police lathi-charge at Bhai Bakhtaur on October 1 and later arrested, Ugrah group leaders are trying to give an impression to villagers that the police had directed their anger only against them since they were the ones who had refused to settle for a compromise.

3,City police arrest accused in Daman MLA's murder,"AHMEDABAD: Subhas Bhaskar (35), an accused in the murder of Damanâ€™s former Congress MLA Kalidas Patel, was nabbed here by city police on Sunday. The former MLA, a liquor trader himself, was shot at point blank range on January 6 when he was emerging after offering prayers at a temple in Bhimpore village in the Union Territory.

Bhaskar alias Anna is undergoing treatment for knife injuries at the L G Hospital where cops have placed him under arrest. Bhaskar, whose notoriety can be gauged from the fact that a reward of Rs 50,000 had been announced by the Daman police for his arrest, was a fallout of the arrest of another notorious bootlegger and history-sheeter Mahalingam Murugam Pillai alias Shiva (30).

Pillai was held near the VS Hospital on Sunday afternoon on a tip-off. A country-made pistol, with a misfired catridge, was seized from him. During interrogation Pillai revealed that he had attacked Bhaskar, a former partner in crime, with a knife on Thursday. He also tried to shoot him with his pistol but it misfired. Pillai revealed that Bhaskar was at the LG Hospital under the fake identity of Vishwanath.

Pillai, accused of drugpeddling and other crimes had been convicted in an NDPS offence and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. In July 2003, he escaped the police when he was being brought to the Bhadra court for a hearing in another case and had been at large since. Bhaskar and Pillai are also wanted in two separate cases at Vadodara and Amraiwadi area of Ahmedabad respectively for firing at police officials and resisting arrest.

Pillai had met Bhaskar when they were both lodged at the Sabarmati Central Jail. Bhaskar had been arrested in a case of looting an angadia and murdering the courier man. They also met another PASA detainee Ramesh Patel alias Michael. Patel, who is a notorious bootlegger based in Daman and has cases of criminal offences against him in Mehsana, hatched the conspiracy to kill the former MLA while in judicial custody. â€œInvestigations have revealed that later when Patel was at the Daman jail he entrusted the contract killing to Bhaskar,â€� informed DCP (Zone I) Ajay Kumar Tomar.

On October 2, Pillai fell out with Bhaskar over some woman whom Bhaskar offended. Incidentally, Pillai held her in high esteem. â€œWhen Pillai was arrested on an informerâ€™s tip-off the whole conspiracy and Daman-murder mystery was solved. The Daman police have already been intimated and a team has been sent to Ahmedabad. Bhaskar will be handed over to them,â€� added Tomar.

4,'Activating new law a must for empowering villages',"PUNE: A member of the advisory board of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has urged the commission to seize the opportunity provided by the new Electricity Act, 2003, and take bold steps to address the problem of rural electrification.

Anil K Rajvanshi, recipient of the Jamnalal Bajaj award, has emphasised, in a letter to MERC chairman P Subramanyam, that the acute shortfall in rural electrification can be overcome if the MERC allows captive power plants or microutilities to generate up to 500 kWe of power.

A large number of such microutilities, functioning along the lines of cable operators, will help ease the problem of power shortages, Rajvanshi has said in his letter, dated October 1.

Rajvanshi, incidentally, is the principal author of the national policy on â€œtaluka self-sufficient power plantsâ€� which is a part of the prime ministerâ€™s programme on rural electrification.

He has emphasised that MERC can invoke sections 13 and 86 (2) of the new Electricity Act, 2003, and exempt all such microutilities from the provisions of tariff fixation and licensing.

While section 86(2) empowers the MERC to advise the government on policy issues, section 13 allows the commission to exempt rural co-operatives and gram panchayats from seeking licences for setting up captive power plants.

The Phaltan-based IIT alumnus, who has done pioneering work in renewable energy and sustainable development, has pointed out that in rural areas, 500 kWe of power â€œcan easily provide electricity for lighting and other usage to about 2000 households.â€�

The insistence on a co-operative society structure for such microutiliites would ensure community participation while providing protection against the negative aspects of a private enterprise, he said.

Significantly, Rajvanshi has highlighted that a captive power plant of 500 kWe capacity could be run on alternative energies such as biomass or bio-derived fuels such as ethanol and pyrolysis oil.

Besides, the power co-operative society can also use a mix of wind, solar, diesel and biomass which might help in developing innovative technologies for such applications, he stated.

Allowing microutilities to function in this manner would not only prove to be a revolutionary step for the MERC but also be the first order of its kind with far-reaching consequences, Rajvanshi said.

7,Solapur debacle: It's govt vs party?,"NEW DELHI: The current blame game in Maharashtra Congress in the wake of the defeat in the Solapur bypolls appears to be a government versus organisation tiff, especially after MPCC chief Ranjit Deshmukh met party chief Sonia Gandhi. The matter also seems to have acquired the inevitable Maratha non-Maratha twist.

Deshmukh ridiculed suggestions being made in the party circles that â€˜â€˜Maratha consolidationâ€™â€™ â€” both NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Deshmukh are Marathas wh-ile CM Sushilkumar Shinde is not â€” had cost the party dear.

After his â€˜â€˜very goodâ€™â€™ 30-minute meeting with Sonia, Deshmukh sought to contradict Shindeâ€™s earlier complaint to Sonia that the Lok Sabha seat could have been won if Pawar had campaigned. The NCPâ€™s nominee, Deshmukh said, had lost the deposit when it contested the seat on its own in 1991.

â€˜â€˜Therefore, this could be one of the factors, but not the only one,â€™â€™ he told reporters. He contended that the party organisation was in no way responsible for the Solapur debacle, but declined to comment on whether a â€˜â€˜surgeryâ€™â€™ was needed at the governmental level. Deshmukh said he had presented a â€˜â€˜factual reportâ€™â€™ to Sonia about the bypoll outcome and had said that the state Congress â€˜â€˜cannot be held responsibleâ€™â€™.

8,Right conditions must for a fair trial in riot cases,"NEW DELHI: The mass acquittal of the accused in the massacre of 21 persons at Best Bakery in Vadodara during last yearâ€™s Gujarat riots has raised certain crucial issues. Are such judicial orders, apparently based on misconception of criminal law and the suppressive attitude of the pro-accused prosecution, valid? Can the Supreme Court order retrial in a case where the trial court has acquitted all the accused?

Earlier judgments in riot cases may perhaps provide an answer. Way back in 1984, the Supreme Court quashed a Kolkata additional sessions judge order acquitting all the nine accused in a riot case in which some persons were killed.

It also ordered re-trial of the accused on the same charges. It said the trial would be conducted in an area not hostile to the witnesses or complainants. The Citizens for Justice and Peace, which is litigating for justice to the victims of Gujarat riots, has sought reinvestigation and retrial of certain cases because it did not expect fair play by a biased state government.

In the Kolkata case, the accused persons were defended by a public prosecutor who had earlier counselled them. It was found that the ruling party supported the accused. When the trial was on and the evidence recorded, a number of ruling party members would assemble in the courtâ€™s compound and create a hostile atmosphere by shouting pro-accused slogans. The complainant was intimidated but the court did not give him protection to enable him to give his evidence fearlessly.

Earlier, In 1997, the apex court dealt with an appeal filed by the accused who were acquitted in a rioting case which had claimed one life. The deceasedâ€™s grand-father sent a letter to the high court seeking retrial and the high court allowed his plea. The apex court also upheld the Madhya Pradesh High Courtâ€™s decision. The high court as also the Supreme Court relied on the apex courtâ€™s judgments in Ayodhya vs Ram Sinner (1981). The apex court and the high court could order retrial if it was found that there was non-application of mind by the trial court.

In 1958, while dealing with an appeal (G X Francis vs Banhku Bihari Singh) seeking trial of a case involving Christian community outside Madhya Pradesh, the apex court said: â€˜â€˜Confidence in the fairness of a trial held in such an atmosphere would be seriously undermined... because the machinery of justice is not geared to work in the midst of such conditions.â€™â€™

The trial courts are under an obligation to maintain an atmosphere conducive to fair trial so that the witnesses and victims of crime do not feel intimidated by the justice system.

9,Self-rule for Iraqis will take time: Bush,"WASHINGTON: US President Bush on Saturday asked for time in working out a plan for Iraqi self-rule even as he faces doubt from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan about US plans.

""The transition to self-government is a complicated process, because it takes time to build trust and hope after decades of oppression and fear,"" Bush said in his weekly radio address.

""Yet we are making steady progress, and we will keep our promise to fully return Iraq''s government to Iraq''s people as soon as possible,"" he said.

Bush also sought to allay concerns in the US Congress over his $87 billion spending request for Iraq.

""Our coalition is helping to train and equip Iraq''s new army, so that Iraqis can take over border protection and other security duties as soon as possible,"" he said.

Democrats on Saturday took Bush to task for his proposals on Iraq''s rebuilding, saying too many resources are being drained from domestic needs.

""In a time when money is scarce, we should demand that President Bush place the needs of our own country first on the agenda,"" Missouri Gov. Bob Holden said in the Democrats'' weekly radio address.

""With record deficits, the worst economy in 70 years, and an administration likely to push even more tax cuts for the wealthy, this funding request raises important concerns about what we can afford to spend to rebuild Iraq,"" he said.

With unease about the costs growing, the administration has been negotiating with members of the United Nations Security Council in hopes of securing a resolution that will encourage contributions from abroad of troops and cash.

But debate over the transition to Iraqi sovereignty has raised serious obstacles to the effort.

The United Nations wants sovereignty handed over within months to an interim government, possibly by expanding the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council, which could then ask for political and military assistance.
