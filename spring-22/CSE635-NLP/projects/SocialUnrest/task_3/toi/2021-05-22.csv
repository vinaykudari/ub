0,Interview debate: 150 schools protest,"NEW DELHI: More than 150 schools on Friday approached the high court against a petition which has challenged their practice of interviewing children seeking admission to nursery classes as well as their parents.

The schools responded to a public notice which was issued by the directorate of education following a HC direction.

Justices Dalveer Bhandari and R C Jain had asked the directorate to bring out a notice when three parents approached the court after a single judge dismissed their petition to cease this practise.

Bhandari and Jain asked the directorate to come out with the notice since the issue concerned was related to several schools in Delhi and not just one.

The judges had also invited suggestions from the schools and their side of the story.

While 50 schools were represented by one group, Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Schools, some had marked their presence individually.

The schools requested the court for time to file a reply. On their submission the judges postponed the hearing of the matter to July 25.

Ashok Aggarwal, who appeared on behalf of the parents, asked the court to pass an interim direction. The court, however, refused saying: ""Admissions for this academic session are already over.""

On February 23, the court had issued notice to Montfort school, its principal, the L-G and directorate of education on the petition of the parents who claimed interview of children for admission is ""arbitrary and violates their human rights."" The parents have suggested draw of lots as an alternative.

Failure of schools to implement the neighbourhood school scheme is also a part of the petition.

Aggarwal said that with an increase in incidents involving school buses, the government had on April 9, 1997 issued a directive asking schools to admit students residing within a radius of three kms.

1,Power(ful) time for ministers,"NEW DELHI: While you may be paying through your nose for electricity bills and waiting with bated breath for the next hike in power tariff, Delhi ministers have happily palmed off their bills on the public exchequer.

Along with other perks and privileges Delhi cabinet ministers get an electricity allowance of Rs 5,000 per month. This limit, however, has been waived off recently.

So unlike ordinary mortals who run about switching off lights and fans to prevent an escalating bill, ministerial residences can enjoy their ''powerful'' existence at ease.

Since last year, most residents have been plagued by erratic power supply and inflated bills. While propagating conservation of energy and resources, Delhi government thinks nothing of curbing its own expenses to prevent an added burden on the public.

Most ministers feel that unlimited expenditure is welcome as they are working for the public.

""Ministerial residences double up as their offices and people from their constituency visit them. But a ceiling on any allowance prevents wasteful expenditure,"" a Delhi government official said.

Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit said: ""I don''t think there should be a limit to the electricity allowance as it is not a personal expense. I am an individual living in my official residence but there are so many meetings and interactions. We also receive a large number of guests and the expenses are not personal.""

Delhi power and transport minister Haroon Yusuf agreed that the current allowance was too little. ""Rs 5,000 is too little.

""At a minister''s residence we have to keep lights on in almost every room because of the number of people and security concerns. Also many public representatives are present at any given time. If we had a better salary it would have been different,"" Yusuf said.

He added that he was practising power conservation and his bill was well within limits.

2,Kakodkar smells foul play in Barc incident,"PUNE: The radioactive exposure of three employees at the Bhabha atomic research centre unit (Barc) near Tarapur on April 17 was due to disciplinary failure and not an accident, said Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Kakodkar, who is also the secretary of the department of atomic energy (DAE,) said he suspected foul play in the incident.

A full inquiry has been initiated to find out how a ""radioactive bottle"" was found at a place where it was not supposed to be, Kakodkar said, while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme at the College of military engineering (CME) here on Friday.

""Senior safety officials, as well as an independent group, are already investigating into the incident,"" he said, admitting that this is the first-of-its-kind incident at any nuclear establishment in the country.

Barc, in a statement, said the three employees received doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.03 Rem, which is very low exposure as compared to the permissible annual dose of 2 Rem.

Kakodkar said though a strict security regime is followed at all the Barc units, the committee is specifically looking into the administrative as well as security aspects of the issue. ""A clear picture is likely to emerge after the committee submits its report,"" he added.

The incident, which occurred on April 17 this year, was noticed by the personnel working in the laboratory. Some employees have even cited personal enmity between two employees as the reason behind the incident.

Meanwhile,Kakodkar said the indigenous design of the advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR) is currently undergoing safety evaluation. ""We hope to get the approval from the government by the end of this year,"" he said, adding that once that is done, the construction of the AHWR, which will use thorium as fuel, will begin immediately.

""It will generate 300 MWe of nuclear power, and mark the beginning of the third phase of the country''s nuclear electricity programme in which thorium will power a string of reactors."" Kakodkar said the AHWR proposed at Kalpakkam will be treated as a ""technology demonstrator for thorium utilisation.

3,Rebels protest Cong. stand on land de-zoning,"PUNE: The controversial move by the ruling Congress to approve a proposal aimed at de-zoning 21 hectares of prime land in Bibvewadi â€” reserved for a timber market in the Development Plan of Pune â€” has evoked a strong protest within the party.

Led by former mayor Vandana Chavan, two senior Congress corporators â€” Shiva Mantri and Sham Mankar â€” have written to chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday, urging him to stay the resolution approved by the general body of the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) on Thursday.

In their letter, they have pointed out that municipal commissioner Sanjay Kumar has opined that the said land can be utilised for some other civic amenity, if not for shifting the timber market from Bhavani Peth to Bibvewadi. The corporators have urged Shinde to give them a hearing during his scheduled visit to Pune on May 23.

Congress corporator from Yerwada, Bapurao Karne, has also protested against the party''s move to dereserve four plots of prime land in Yerwada. Karne has formed an action committee to save the reserved lands.

4,"Bonhomie at Centre, clashes in Bengal","KOLKATA: Incidents of post-poll clashes between CPM and Congress workers in West Bengal may be a thorn in the flesh for a Left-supported Congress-led government at the Centre.

Irate PCC leaders have already submitted a memorandum to the chief minister and threatened to call a Bangla bandh in June.

According to PCC leader Manas Bhuiyan, more than 50 clashes took place between supporters of the two parties since the May 10 elections.

Four Congress supporters were killed â€” three in Murshidabad and one in Purulia. The situation was the worst in Murshidabad, where the CPM was defeated in all the three Lok Sabha seats and also lost the zilla parishad to the Congress.

""The Marxists are desperate to recover the lost ground in Murshidabad,"" Bhuiyan said. In West Midnapore, the Congress office at Khirpai was attacked. The house of Nadia district Congress president Shankar Singh was ransacked, Bhuiyan said. The CPM workers are now trying to settle scores with those who had not voted for their party, he added.

The CPM, on the other hand, blamed the Congress for attack on a cadre who had worked in a Howrah booth. At Chakda, a CPM victory procession was allegedly attacked by Congress supporters.

Politically, it would be convenient for both the parties if the friendship between the two in Delhi was not maintained in West Bengal, observers said. Because, if the Trinamul emerged as the only credible opposition party in the state, all anti-CPM votes would go to that party in the next Assembly elections.

Significantly, state DIG (headquarters) Raj Kanojia said on Friday that the police were yet to receive a formal complaint from the Congress about an alarming level of post-poll violence in the state. ""The situation is quite under control,"" he said.

According to Kanojia, the only serious incident took place on Thursday at Gokarna in Burdwan. Two persons were killed in a clash between supporters of the Trinamul and the CPM. He said it was possible that clashes over land disputes and other local quarrels were now being described as post-poll violence.

Bhuyan, however, said this was not surprising. ""The CPM generally attacks political adversaries under various pretexts, like land disputes, family feuds and personal quarrels.""

Trinamul leader Pankaj Banerjee said both those killed in Gokarna were supporters of his party.

5,'Laloo not bothered about development',"PATNA: The Bihar unit of BJP on Friday criticised RJD national president Laloo Prasad Yadav for allegedly demanding plum portfolios in the Congress-led government at the Centre.

BJP general secretary Giriraj Singh and party spokesperson Kiran Ghai, in a joint statement issued here, said Laloo is talking about development of Bihar but people know that development had never been on his agenda. They said that Laloo had raised the issue of special package for Bihar to demand important portfolios for himself and other RJD MPs. It was evident from the fact that RJD chief had demanded special package for Bihar before the formation of a government at the Centre, Singh and Ghai added.

The BJP leaders said Laloo had failed to utilise adequate central assistance to develop the state even during the regime of United Front (UF) government. They also lashed out at the state government for its failure to stop kidnapping in the state.

6,"Manmohan, Sonia hold talks on govt formation","NEW DELHI: Ahead of the swearing-in of Congress-led coalition government on Saturday, Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi had a marathon six-hour long meeting late on Friday night to finalise the Council of Ministers.

The meeting, which began at 8 pm and ended at 2 am on Friday, was the second in the day, with Singh earlier holding seven-hour long talks with Gandhi and other senior party leaders to firm up the Council of Ministers in the backdrop of some allies vouching for certain portfolios.

None of the leaders, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ambika Soni and Ahmed Patel, spoke to the waiting media after the meeting, saying everything would be known later on Saturday.

The new Council of Ministers will be sworn in on Saturday at 5.30 pm. But it was not immediately known how many ministers will be administered the oath of office and secrecy along with Singh.

This is the first time that the Congress is sharing power at the Centre with allies and, therefore, the exercise is having its twists and turns with pulls and pressures from within the party and the partners.

There has been no firm word about participation of RJD in the government till late in the night even though indications to that effect were given by party chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.

7,Five sisters commit suicide,"GUWAHATI: In a shocking incident, five sisters have committed suicide by hanging from ceiling fans at Diphu in Assam''s Karbi Anglong district on Friday night.

The bodies of the five sisters between the ages of 18 and 31 years were found hanging in their respective rooms, two inside one room and three of them in three rooms of the house of their father U C Bordoloi, a retired assistant executive engineer of the Public Health Department, on Saturday morning, Diphu Sadar police told TNN.

Their parents were in the house at SDC Colony in the Diphu town when the incident took place. Police added that the bodies were hanging from the ceiling fans tied with plastic ropes.

Police said the sisters left one suicide note, which was jointly signed. ""No one is responsible for our death. We are committing suicide according to our will. No one is to be blamed,"" the women wrote in the letter, sources said.

The eldest sister identified as Anuradha Bordoloi Bora had got married on May 10 and was on a visit to her parents'' house. The other sisters are Jayarani (29), Neelakshi (26), Nabanita (23) and Priyambada (18).

8,'Operation Bluestar to remain politically relevant',"LUDHIANA: Punjab BJP president and newly elected MP from Hoshiarpur, Avinash Rai Khanna on Friday asserted that issues like Operation Bluestar and anti-Sikh riots in Delhi would remain politically relevant for generations to come.

Maintaining that people of the country will never forget the Congress party''s anti-Sikh role, he dismissed the contention of certain senior Akali leaders about positive change in Sikh opinion about the Congress party.

He reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi''s refusal to become PM was due to strong sentiment prevailing countrywide against her candidature. ""The electorate showed that the country should not go into the hands of firangis again,"" he said in the news conference at circuit house here.

Khanna demanded resignation of chief minister Amarinder Singh for losing people''s confidence as shown by the just concluded Lok Sabha polls. He claimed Amarinder would be unable to do anything for the state despite having Congress led government at centre.

""Amarinder Singh is basically an incompetent person,"" said Khanna when asked. Though the factors responsible for his party''s defeat will be analysed in the BJP''s national executive meet, Khanna felt that pre-poll alliances and public resentment against respective state governments could be the reasons behind the defeat.

When asked pointedly if it meant BJP did not win in Punjab on the strength of the issues raised by it, Khanna admitted it was definitely the anti-incumbency factor. At the same time, non-performance of the state government was one of their two poll issues, he said.

He would raise the issue of establishing oil refinery at Bhatinda in the Parliament besides highlighting human rights violations committed by the Amarinder''s government during the recent polls. He asserted no change in the party setup in Punjab after the polls. Khanna held meetings of the state office bearers and executive committee to broadbase the party in Punjab.

9,Soni turns down ministerial berth,"NEW DELHI: Emulating Congress President Sonia Gandhi, AICC General Secretary Ambika Soni on Saturday turned down an offer of a ministerial berth in the Manmohan Singh government, saying she would like to work with the motto of ""selflessness and service to the nation"".

In a letter to Gandhi, Soni said ""today you have asked me to serve as a member in the Council of Ministers of the Government of India. A singular honour for every political worker. But I am also one of those who have been inspired by your unique example.

""Allow me to emulate you. I too would like to work with your motto of selflessness and service to the nation above everything else,"" she said.

""Therefore, in all humility I request you to ask the Prime Minister not to include me in his Cabinet. My close association with you is very valuable to me and I cherish it,"" she said.

Reminding Gandhi of her decision to renounce Prime Ministership, Soni said that it had ""electrified"" the world and reiteration of her commitment as Congress President had ""strengthened"" the secular ethos of the Indian polity.

""You have enthused party workers across the country. You have dealt a lethal blow to all those who have been ranting and raving about sectarian and divisive issues. Yours has been an act unparalleled in political history,"" she added.

10,BJP convenes legislature party meet,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka unit of BJP has convened its Legislature party meeting here on Sunday, even as uncertainty continued over formation of a government in the state after the assembly polls threw up a fractured verdict.

The BJP, which has emerged as the single largest party with 79 seats in the 224-member house, will be electing its Legislature party leader at the meeting, presided over by the party president, M Venkaiah Naidu.

Naidu would arrive here on Sunday well ahead of the meeting, slated for 1100 hours, BJP sources said.

State unit BJP president Anantkumar and campaign committee chairman B S Yediyurappa are likely to be in the race for the legislature party leader post, the sources hinted.

Yediyurappa has won the Shikaripura assembly seat in Shimoga district, while Anantkumar retained the Bangalore South Lok Sabha seat for the fourth successive term.

The issue of government formation will also come up for debate at the meeting, though the party is not in a position to install its first ever government due to lack of support from other parties.

Though the BJP made an offer to support JDS, the latter spurned it, shattering its hopes of government formation.

The JDS is now struggling to seek Congress support to install the party led coalition government in the state.

11,Chautala begins political pilgrimage,"CHANDIGARH: The drubbing given by Haryana''s electorate to the ruling Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in the general election has forced Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala to hit the road to salvage his demoralised party.

Chautala''s political pilgrimage over the next 10 months would be crucial for his own survival and that of the INLD.

Elections to the 90-seat state assembly are scheduled for February-March next year and the results of the parliamentary polls have shown the INLD is on a sticky wicket.

The Congress, on a comeback trail in Haryana, bagged nine of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state. One seat, Sonepat, went to the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), whose candidate defeated his Congress rival by a small margin.

The Congress led in 71 of the 90 assembly segments. State Congress chief and former chief minister Bhajan Lal is excited at the results.

""We will sweep the state in the next assembly polls. The Chautala government will fall,"" he claimed.

Following the rout, Chautala announced sops for all sections of the people -- government employees, farmers, the aged and women. His political advisers have chalked out a long tour plan that would take Chautala to most parts of Haryana in the next 10 months.

""The idea is to reach out to the people. Party cadres have told Chautala that despite announcing welfare measures for people in rural areas, the message did not reach the masses,"" a close political aide confided.

The Chautala clan is also likely to become more accessible to people and party cadres in the next few months.

In the 1999 general election, INLD had bagged five Lok Sabha seats while its ally, the BJP, won the other five. The Congress was then wiped out.

This time, INLD and BJP parted ways due to serious differences. Chautala''s two sons - Ajay and Abhay - lost individually in Bhiwani and Kurukshetra Lok Sabha seats, dealing him a double blow.

Ajay finished a poor third behind Congress and Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) candidates in Bhiwani, which he represented in the last Lok Sabha.

Industrialist Naveen Jindal, a Congress candidate, won in Kurukshetra, defeating Abhay Chautala, contesting for parliament for the first time, by over 160,000 votes.

Though Chautala believes he will be able to turn the tide before the next assembly polls, things do not look smooth for him.

14,'Talks with Congress inconclusive',"BANGALORE: Karnataka unit JDS President Siddaramaiah on Saturday described as mere ""speculation"" that his party has agreed to the Congress led coalition in the state, asserting that ""nothing has been decided and talks are inconclusive"".

Siddaramaiah, talking to reporters on his return from New Delhi, said there was no change in JDS'' stand adopted at the May 16 legislature party meeting to the effect of forming the party led coalition government with Congress support in the wake of 12th Assembly election giving a fractured verdict.

He said, former Prime Minister and JDS Chief H D Devegowda met Congress President Sonia Gandhi last night and placed the demand of his party before her.

During the course of 30-minute face-to-face meeting, Sonia Gandhi suggested to Gowda that since the Congress is a national party, the JDS accept Maharastra model coalition, implying that the new dispensation should be led by her party, he said.

Gowda, who disagreed with Congress President''s proposal brought to her notice that in the backdrop of the electorate rejecting Congress, the party should support JDS led coalition.

Gowda and Sonia would be meeting in New Delhi either on May 24 or 25 to discuss the issue, Siddaramaiah said.

In a significant development the JDS has convened its Legislature Party meeting on May 24 to take stock of the situation and seek MLAs opinion on the future plan of action.

The Congress has also scheduled its Legislature party meeting on the same day.
