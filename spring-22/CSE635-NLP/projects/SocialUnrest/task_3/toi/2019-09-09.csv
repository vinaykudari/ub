0,220 preventive arrests made to stop bus robbery,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to control the sudden spurt in crime on moving buses, the Delhi Police rounded-up about 220 persons under various preventive sections over the weekend.

The police said 56 pickpockets were arrested in south Delhi while 44 more were arrested in west Delhi. In southwest Delhi, 41 pickpockets were arrested. In north Delhi, the police arrested 17 pickpockets and in northwest Delhi 14 were arrested. In central and east Delhi, the police have arrested 22 and six pickpockets respectively.

The action follows police commissioner R S Gupta summoning senior officials on Saturday evening. The law and order meeting was attended by the three joint commissioners of police and 12 deputy commissioners (DCP).

At the meeting, Gupta ordered his subordinates to crackdown on criminals who have been released on bail. He also told the officers that the accused who are absconding should be arrested soon.

Within one weekâ€™s time, Gupta has summoned senior officers twice on the issue of bus robberies. The earlier occasion was on Wednesday when a bus robbery was reported in central Delhi.

Last month, the police commissioner had also ordered a crackdown on petty criminals. Delhiites have been stunned by the five bus robberies and hijacking reported since September 1. In the last such incident on Friday, a Delhi University student was molested by some assailants who had hijacked a Mudrika bus in northwest Delhi. The girl jumped off the bus and sustained injuries.

In another case, two teenagers were pushed off a bus near Kashmiri Gate after two assailants tried to snatch the money they were carrying. One died on the spot, another succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

The police have also deployed plainclothes policemen in buses for surprise checking. On Saturday, the police conducted surprise checks in 106 buses. The police have decided to install more pickets and barricades at lonely stretches and more emphasis will be put on buses going towards the university area.

Some sensitive areas where such incidents can take place have also been identified. Senior police officials are also holding talks with drivers and conductors. The bus drivers have been asked to stop at a picket under such circumstances. â€˜â€˜If they are under threat then they should start the blinkers,â€™â€™ a senior police officer said.

1,IBM team in city to discuss IT investments,"KOLKATA: A team from the IBM will be in Kolkata on Monday to discuss investments in software, West Bengal information technology minister Manabendra Mukherjee said in Kolkata on Sunday. IBM would also help the state government in imparting basic computer education in 500 more schools.

Talking to newspersons on the occasion of the signing of a MoU for setting up communication hub centres at Kharagpur and Durgapur, he said the IBM team would have representatives from both their learning divi-sions and their investment division. The IBM team would discuss in-vestment proposals with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a meeting on Tuesday.

He said the state government had plans to introduce basic computer edu-cation in 1,000 schools in the coming five years. There were 10,500 schools in the state, but many of them did not have power and other infrastructure necessary for computer education. So far, the state government had introduced basic computer eduction in 300 higher secondary schools, from class VII to class XII, the nodal agency being Webel. The NIIT had helped the Webel in 100 of these schools, the Wipro in 100 schools and the IBM in 100.

The state government wanted to rope in big names in IT in the computer education schme because it wanted to have a uniformity in the value of the certificates that would be given to students of different schools. Be-sides, smaller companies found it difficult to cope with the problem of frequent obsolescence in the IT sector found it difficult to operate outside Kolkata.

The MoU signed between the Software Technology Park of India and the state IT department would pave the way for the setting up of the second and the third hub centres in the state at Durgapur and Kharagpur. The first STPI earth station was set up at software technology park in Kolkata with high capacity international satellite connectivity through VSNL and STPI.

Mukherjee said the short-term focus of the state government would be on IT-enabled services. A recent NASSCOM survey had placed Kolkata fourth out of nine cities having potential to attract ITES business. Global consultants McKinsey had helped the state government in having detailed interactions with 36 potential investors, 11 multinational companies looking for ITES centres, 12 IT service providers and 13 third party ITES providers. These were shortlisted after contacting over 70 companies.

He said Reliance Infocom was setting up a Rs 800 crore optical fibre ca-ble network in the state which would provide â€œgreater bandwidthâ€� for knowledge-based industries and provide link to the â€œnational broadband accessâ€�. The project involved the laying of 4,000 km of optical fibre ca-bles linking Kolkata with all the districts. Of this, 1,560 km of cable would be within the city.

3,Equity issue: CCB forum to meet co-operative minister,"LUCKNOW: Disappointed at the indifference showed by the registrar of the cooperative societies and the principal secretary, cooperatives, the CCB depositorsâ€™ forum at its meeting on Sunday decided to meet minister for cooperatives Ram Prakash Tripathi and request him to send reminders to institutional depositors like the UPFC, who are unable to contribute towards the equity share of the CCB, citing technical reasons that their rules did not permit for the same.

The forum suggested that deposits of these institutional depositors must be frozen for a period of 15 years as long-term deposits, on which the CCB might pay interest at a nominal rate of 6 per cent or as agreed upon by the CCBâ€™s administrator or as suggested by the RBI. The CCB Depositorsâ€™ Forum has also written a letter to the UPFC for taking early action in the matter so that early revival of the CCB takes place. The forum has also written to the minister for cooperatives to direct the principal secretary, cooperatives, and the registrar of cooperative societies, who are reluctant to take steps for early revival.

Institutional Depositors of the CCB, like the UPFC and 12 other institutions had refused to convert their money into the bankâ€™s equity for the revival as they said that constitutional provisions in their Acts/ bylaws/ rules did not allow investments in equity share of any other organisation. These depositors together have Rs 31 crore in the bank and without their cooperation the revival cannot take place.

Forum members rued that despite their repeated complaints and requests, the registrar of cooperative societies and the principal secretary, cooperatives, were not taking adequate steps in this regard. They said that institutional depositors should understand that if the RBI ordered liquidation of the CCB the entire money of the institutional depositors would be gone as it was not covered under the DICGC. Only the money belonging to small depositors, up to Rs one lakh, is insured, under this scheme.

5,UP govt’s ‘Russian connection’,"LUCKNOW: A Russian firm Techno Prom Export (TPE), blacklisted in Bangladesh for supplying sub-standard material, has, if reports are to be believed, some supporters in CM Mayawatiâ€™s secretariat who are putting pressure on UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam (UPRVUN) officials to favour the firm to carry out repairs worth Rs 334 in five Obra units.

The name of the controversial Bhawna Pandey, who tried to clinch a few favours from the Mayawati government, is allegedly among those involved in trying to get the deal through. A BSP minister and a senior bureaucrat are also reported to have put undue pressure on UPRVUN officials to acceed to the TPE demand of amending certain provisions in the contract so that it could find favour. The deal with the TPE saw the unceremonious exit of UPRVUN CMD Ranveer Singh on June 21. A junior officer in the department AS Kapoor replaced him with a view to ensuring that the contract of TPE is amended suitably.

The Russian firm had bagged Rs 334 crore contract for renovating five 50 MW units of Obra power plant in 1999. The five units, set-up in 1967, have run their full 30-year life. Tenders for repair and renovation were floated in 1998 by the then UPSEB with a condition that payment for repairs would be made to the interested parties in 10 years. No private firm came forward to accept these terms. The board then arranged funds from the Power Finance Corporation and got the repair scheme approved by the Central Electricity Authority. Then fresh tenders were floated and TPE clinched the deal for being the lowest bidder. A 6-member committee negotiated the price and the deal was finally decided in favour of the Russian firm in 2001 for Rs 334 with 100 per cent advance.

In January this year, letters of intent were issued to TPE for executing repair work. But TPE has been mounting pressure on UPRVUN to amend certain provisions in the contract, including a 5 per cent capping on price increase. A BSP minister and a senior bureaucrat allegedly coerced UPRVUN to accede to the demand. On its part, the UPRVUN sent an implication report direct to Mayawati. After coming to know about the Bhawna Pandey connection and â€˜kickbacksâ€™, an infuriated Mayawati constituted a nine-member panel to take a final decision on the deal with the Russian firm.

Although the committee in its September 2 meeting has rejected TPEâ€™s demands, pressure is still on from the Fifth Floor to ensure that the the Russian deal is through.

6,SSB creating law & order problem: IG,"PATNA: The Special Services Bureau (SSB) deployed by the Union home ministry along the Indo-Nepal border in Bihar, has come in for severe criticism by Bihar police for creating â€˜law and orderâ€™ problems in the border districts of the state. The IG, Darbhanga zone, V Narayanan, in a recent letter to police headquarters, has detailed several â€˜questionable activities of SSB jawansâ€™ posted in the zone. He has urged the police headquarters to inform the Union home ministry to take â€œappropriate action to rein in the questionable activities of SSB ... lest the outrage of local public against the central para-military force puts the government in an embarrassing situationâ€�. In Darbhanga police zone, 44 platoons of SSB are posted in Madhubani, Kishanganj, Araria and Supaul districts to check smuggling and other subversive activities. Unlike other paramilitary forces, the constitution, functioning and deployment of SSB are not governed by any statutory Act and it is expected to assist the local police and uphold the law of the land. The Darbhanga IG has dubbed the SSB as a â€œhighly indisciplinedâ€� force. â€œEven senior officers of SSB several times plead inability to control the indisciplined behaviour of their jawans,â€� he has pointed out. It has further been pointed out that the SSBâ€™s anti-smuggling activities did not meet with much success and other agencies, like the customs and DRI, have played a leading role in this regard. â€œIn many cases, SSB jawans were spotted abetting smuggling activities for monetary consideration. At times, such monetary considerations fuelled disputes among SSB men, resulting into infighting among them.â€� It has been pointed out that on August 22 this year, in Village Balbhadarpur in Supaul district, three SSB men chased ex-mukhiya Belal Ahmad and killed him. The SSB men were taking sides in a local dispute pertaining to panchayat polls. The incident enraged the local public and the jawans were arrested. However, other SSB jawans ran amuck and did not allow production of the three jawans before a court, ignoring the orders of their officials. The SSB jawans lathicharged the local people and prevented the local police from discharging their duties, the Darbhanga IG has said. In Supaul district on April 4 this year, SSB inspector Harendra Kumar Bhardolia was shot dead by an SSB jawan, Gichak Marik. The firearms used were seized and a case was instituted under Section 302 of IPC against Marik. In Madhubani district, SSB jawans have been reported to misbehave with women in an inebriated condition and committing crime. On March 3, 2002, in village Jhalalun under the Ladiana police station of Madhubani, some SSB jawans of Piprahi camp attempted to rape a woman after forcibly entering her house. The incident sent shock waves among the local population. On July 15, SSB jawans fought among themselves over the distribution of booty made from illegal check-posts being operated by the jawans under Andhramath police station of Madhubani district. A jawan, Martoribo, opened fire killing jawan Kamrik Tajub and injuring yet another jawan Jiten Hazarika. Martoribo was killed by some other SSB jawans in retaliation. In Kishanganj, on March 29, SSB jawans took law in their own hands by siding with one party in getting a shop vacated in the local bazar, resulting into public outrage and ruckus. â€œThe functioning of the SSB along the Indo-Nepal border leaves much to be desired,â€� the Darbhanga IG has remarked.

7,Pramod raps govt for tech project delays,"KOLKATA: Union information technology minister Pramod Mahajan on Sunday rapped the West Bengal government for delay in implementing two software technology projects in the state.

On the occasion of the signing of an MoU here for setting up communication hub centres at Kharagpur and Durgapur software technology parks, he said the plan had been mooted last November when he was here to inaugurate a similar earth station. â€œIt took 10 months to sign an MoU.With this speed, how can India prosper?â€�

â€œWhat MoU are you signing when the date it is signed on is there, but the date the project is to be completed is not mentioned,â€� Mahajan asked. He promised that if the state was ready to provide the land and the building by March next year, the two hub centres at Kharagpur and Durgapur would be ready by May 1, 2003.

He said 37 software centres had been set up by the STPI so far, but five states had monopolised them. There were five such centres each in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Other states had one each and some had none. With Durgapur and Kharagpur, West Bengal would have three.

8,‘Chandrababu targeting Telangana ministers’,"HYDERABAD: The Congress party has alleged that chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was stoking regional sentiments by taking selective action against ministers hailing from Telangana region.

Speaking to mediapersons on Sunday, APCC president M Satyanarayana Rao said that Naidu should seek the resignation of all ministers accused in various scams instead of only â€˜targetingâ€™ ministers from Telangana.

Referring to the resignation of panchayat raj minister P Srinivas Reddy for his alleged involvement in the stationery scam, the PCC chief demanded that Naidu should apply the same yardstick and remove ministers P Rama Subba Reddy, Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, Nagam Janardhan Reddy, Tummala Nageswara Rao, K Subbarayudu and K E Prabakar also.

He added that caste considerations also played an important role in the continuation of Kodela Sivaprasad Rao in the ministry. He warned that the actions of the chief minister would only accentuate the regional feelings and would cause damage to the unity of the state.

He challenged the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders for a public debate on the comparative development of backward areas during the Congress and TDPâ€™s governments. He reiterated that the Congress party would support the government on the issue of the Krishna water dispute.

Satyanarayana Rao condemned the statements of Naidu against his Kerala counterpart A K Antony on the issue of power tariff hike.

He said that it was unfortunate that Chandrababu Naidu criticised Antony for withdrawing the power tariff hike bowing to public pressure. The PCC chief accused Naidu of being â€˜insensitiveâ€™ to public opinion despite a massive agitation against the power tariff hike effected in the state.

Meanwhile, a senior advocate of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Mohammed Osman Shaheed, joined the Congress party along with his supporters.

9,Transco sop to farmers,"HYDERABAD: Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited (APTransco) has announced a 50 per cent discount on monthly energy charges in slab system or metered system as incentive to agriculture consumers, if they use pumping systems using frictionless foot valves, ISI-marked monobloc pumpsets, capacitors of adequate rating for pumpsets and HDPE piping suction and delivery.

The announcement comes as part of the awareness programme taken up by Transco for conservation of energy in the agriculture sector.

The programme includes introducing demand side management (DSM) measures with special incentives in tariff for efficient running of pumpsets resulting in economising the usage of electricity.

After consumers adopt DSM measures they would have to pay only 10 paise per unit up to 2,500 units consumption per annum and 25 paise per unit for the balance, where meters are provided.

The discount will be applicable up to March 31, 2005.

Transco is also conducting a workshop for departmental officers and staff so that they can effectively propagate DSM measures to agricultural consumers. The corporation expects that by providing DSM measures the voltage profile would be improved for the same output of power.

Transco is also distributing pamphlets in villages so that DSM measures could be popularised.

Transco chairman Rachel Chatterjee said that there was substantial financial support from the government for the agriculture sector. An amount of Rs 1,933.82 crore for 2001-02 and Rs 1,947.46 crore for 2002-03 has been provided to the sector by the government, she added.

10,Check foreign infiltrators: VHP to govt,"RAJAHMUNDRY: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) northeast region secretary K Koteswara Sharma criticised the central government for neglecting the issue of continuous infiltration into Barak Valley.

Speaking to The Times of India at Tadepalligudem on Sunday, he alleged that people from Bangladesh continue to enter the country to take up work in Barak Valley without work permits. He said there was growing resentment from the local people as these workers were staying back in the country.

Koteswara Sharma termed the situation in the northeast as bad as that in Jammu and Kashmir.

Lack of development in the region is the main reason for the rise in anti-nationalist and secessionist trends, he said and added that continuous infiltration into Assam, Meghalaya,Nagaland, Tripura and other states was leading to massive imbalance in the ratio of the population in the northeast region.

12,New power tariff policy by December,"NEW DELHI: The government on Monday said that new power tariff policy, a benchmark for the electricity regulatory commission to set tariffs, is likely to be announced by the end of December this year.

""The draft policy is under discussion... we have received comments from an independent credit rating agency and after having views from all stakeholders - the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, industry bodies, licencees and the generation companies new policy will be announced,"" Union Power Secretary R V Shahi said.

By the end of September, the process of interaction was likely to be completed and next month the draft could take a panel shape, Shahi said, adding that ""it will be a well-balanced policy aiming at integrating the interests of investors, developers and consumers.""

On the apprehension expressed by some of the power generating PSUs over the new tariff policy, the secretary said, ""This is such an act that all the stakeholders cannot be fully satisfied so we will have to do it very carefully.""

The idea behind sending the draft policy to an independent research organisation, CRISIL, was to see that interests of all stakeholders are ensured.

13,"Advani meets ministers, BJP leaders on J&K polls","NEW DELHI: In a major exercise to review the arrangements for the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani on Monday briefed his Cabinet colleagues and BJP leaders about government''s preparations for the crucial polls.

The high-level meeting was attended among others by Union Ministers George Fernandes, Sushma Swaraj, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Shourie, Sharad Yadav, Shahnawaz Hussain, TR Baalu, Digvijay Singh, Uma Bharti, Vijay Goel and BJP President M Venkaiah Naidu.

""This was neither a formal Cabinet meeting, nor an informal one. It was an informal gathering,"" Swaraj told reporters after the 90-minute meeting at North Block.

Stating that government was making efforts to ensure that the elections were ""free, fair, credible and participatory"", she said officials of external affairs, home and defence ministries briefed the meeting about the poll preparations in Jammu and Kashmir.

While sources said that the meeting was also called to ensure that the government spoke ""in one voice"" on the J and K polls which were being keenly monitored by the world community, Swaraj undermined this view saying elections to the state were ""no different from any other state in the country"".

The arrangements by the Election Commission and security agencies were reviewed at the meeting.

To a question how could the government ensure free and fair elections in the state, Swaraj said, ""it is heartening to know that eight to ten thousand people were attending election rallies"".

""What more participation do you want. It is people''s participation which is a guarantee for free and fair polls. Keeping the crowds participating at these rallies in mind, I don''t think we require any other benchmark for fairness of the polls,"" the information and broadcasting minister said.

There were many people who were earlier queueing up outside party offices to seek tickets to contest the polls. ""This showed there was lot of enthusiasm among the people over these elections"".

Earlier, the sources said several ministers exchanged their views over the elections at the meeting, with many of them wanting to know the government''s position on different aspects of the election process.

They said Monday''s exercise was meant to educate the ministers and other leaders about the government''s positions on various issues relating to the J and K polls in order to ensure that everyone spoke in ""one voice"".

14,Booklet lauding Modi govt distributed in Rajkot,"RAJKOT: Finding itself in the dumps post-Godhra, the BJP government led by Narendra Modi has launched a high profile campaign to salvage its sagging image by making maximum use of the state information department.

However, the publicity-seeking chief minister came up with a novel idea of deriving maximum mileage out of the whole exercise. A 32-page pocket-size booklet highlighting the achievements of the Modi government was distributed free of cost during the Janmasthami mela by the information department. The booklet was freely distributed from the counters of the special information department stall during the six-day Janmasthami mela. The aim was to get across to a maximum number of people who visited the mela.

While the front cover of the booklet has a picture of Modi, accompanied by a small write up, the back cover has a picture of the Sardar Sarovar dam and Modi''s slogan of Apnu Gujarat, Agvu Gujarat.

The booklet also has a picture of Sardar Patel and details of the Narmada dam, besides write ups about achievements of each of the ministers. However, there is no mention of the chief minister''s achievements.

The booklet, (which this correspondent procured from the information department stall at the mela), is full of statistical figures supporting the government''s achievements.

It is not known how many such booklets were distributed as the information department here are tight lipped ""as the booklets were sent from Gandhinagar"". Plans are drawn to send the booklets to other such fairs that attract large crowds. The first such opportunity would be the Tarnetar fair.

According to a rough estimate, almost seven lakh people visited the mela and even if half of them visited the information department stall, then as many as 3.5 lakh booklets were distributed free of cost.

The booklet has no mention of the Godhra incident and the people arrested during the riots. The chief minister''s pet scheme of Samras Gam, the now-defunct gram mitra scheme and gram sabha scheme also finds a place in the booklet. Former chief minister Keshubhai Patel''s Gokul Gram scheme has been included in the booklet .

15,5 crore affected by Gujarat riots: NRI team,"AHMEDABAD: They have collected $1 million from the NRIs living in the US, 80 per cent of which has already been spent on the riot-affected people. But they cannot reveal the names of the organisations through which these funds were disbursed, ""because some of them have been threatened,"" says Shrikumar Poddar of the NRI Sadbhavna Mission to India, which is visiting Gujarat for the first time since the riots.

The press conference, addressed by nine of the 14-member team here on Monday, was fraught with emotional outbursts, questions on discrimination - on relief-distribution and first-hand accounts of how discrimination was creeping into the NRI psyche abroad.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi refused to meet the delegation, and so did state health minister Ashok Bhatt, according to Gautam Desai, a delegate who lives in North Carolina. Accompanying the team is Nishrin Hussain, the daughter of late Congress MP Ahsan Jafri, on her first visit home since her father was murdered on February 28 by a riotous mob.

Between tears, anger and discomfiture of the delegates, Poddar said that the whole thing was reminiscent of the Partition and that ""we feel that this kind of thing should not happen again since it has affected five crore Gujaratis"".

The mission, in its three days at Ahmedabad, visited a camp in Shahpur run by the Sadanand Trust, Naroda Patia and Gulbarg Society to get first-hand account of the incidents, some six months after it happened. They will now visit Godhra and Vadodara.

When asked why they had come so late, Nishrin said, ""For people who have passed through it there is no peace even now"". Gautam Desai clarified, ""The real extent of damage was not clear and we had to verify from various sources and get people together from across the US to collect funds.""

Breaking down in the middle of the address, Aditi Desai, who is a UN consultant based in New York, said, ""We have come as human beings and we have not slept nights thinking about what was going on here. We could not face the humiliation abroad when people told us this is happening in your country,"" she continued emphatically.

According to her, ""The strong Hindutva influences as spread by the spokespersons of Hinduism, like the VHP, had spread even in the US, where attempts were being made to interpret history in a different way"", she told TNN.

To questions about visiting families affected by the Godhra carnage, Raju Rajagopal from California said, ""A few members of the delegation would return to Ahmedabad and meet these families too."" ""And also help rehabilitate families, if they are identified,"" added Najma Sultana.

""If you find one family to sponsor one riot-affected family in Gujarat, we will find one in the US or Canada,"" said Poddar. The mission has met with Citizen''s Initiative, Lok Samiti, Islamic Relief Committee, GPCC president Shankersinh Vaghela, Naresh Raval, Shankaracharya Swami Adhokshjanand Saraswati and representatives of some vernacular newspapers.

17,Early elections likely: Cong,"NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership has assessed the present imbroglio in the Union government as a result of an attempt by some BJP allies to retrieve lost ground fearing early elections, particularly in view of popular sentiments against the governmentâ€™s privatisation of public sector companies.

Congress Working Committee member Pranab Mukherjee said general elections were imminent, going by the noises emanating from the NDA government.

Some Opposition leaders believe that with L K Advani becoming the Deputy Prime Minister, two power centres have been created in the government. This, they feel, has led to considerable stress and strain in the coalition.

They assert that unless this contradiction is sorted out by either Advani becoming the PM or Vajpayee consolidating his own position, the pulls and pressures in the government would worsen, leading to a greater crisis in the NDA.

â€˜â€˜I feel that the NDA coalition is in danger. In such a situation, what else can happen but elections? From the noises some of the coalition partners are making, it seems that they feel that elections are near. They know that privatisation is unpopular,â€™â€™ said Mukherjee in an interview to The Times of India.

Mukherjee predicted that the Gujarat assembly elections would determine the future course of the NDA government. â€˜â€˜In India, no coalition has survived for more than two or three years. Prior to this, there was another BJP- led government for over a year. Even this coalition will not complete its term.â€™â€™

18,Congress to probe Modi’s misrule,"RAJKOT: The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Shankersinh Vaghela here on Monday said his party would set up a special commission of inquiry on the Punjab-pattern to probe the misrule and corruption by the BJP during its four-and-a-half years.

Talking to reporters, Vaghela, quoting official sources, said there was a significant rise in corruption in the state during the last three years.

Terming the BJP rule in the state as a â€˜â€˜kalankâ€™â€™ (shame), Vaghela said that the BJP leaders had indulged in large scale corruption in all fields of life. The people had lost faith in the law and order situation and the economy was on a downward slide.

Another Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil termed Modiâ€™s gaurav yatra as â€˜â€˜Kaurav yatraâ€™â€™ which would end in â€˜â€˜smashan yatraâ€™â€™ (funeral procession).

Hasmukh Patel, another Congress leader accompanying Vaghela, said Narendra Modi was making wild allegations against the Congress president Sonia Gandhi because he had â€˜â€˜lost his balance.â€™â€™ Patel warned that if such utterances continued, the Congress too would be forced to speak about the â€˜â€˜known and unknown things about the private life of Modi.â€™â€™

Vaghela said that the current crisis in the cooperative banking sector in the state was also due to the BJP misrule. He said that â€˜â€˜all the BJP people were given large amounts as loansâ€™â€™ by these sick banks.

Referring to the ongoing controversy over the BJP reportedly giving sanction to new slaughter houses, Vaghela said that â€˜â€˜if the Congress was elected to power it would not give clearance to open any new slaughter houses in the state.â€™â€™ He said the peopleâ€™s perception of the BJP as a â€˜â€˜religious- mindedâ€™â€™ party had changed.

Vaghela asked the BJP leaders to give a complete account of the money and material they received during the earthquake as he feared that there was large scale corruption in the distribution of the relief material for the quake victims.

This had led to the rejection of all pleas to reconsider the order for complete conversion of the 10,000-strong city bus fleet into a single-fuel CNG mode.

Terming IGL â€˜â€˜thoroughly incompetentâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜not a reliable companyâ€™â€™, the Bench comprising Chief Justice B N Kirpal, Justice V N Khare and Justice Ashok Bhan said because of the company misleading the court, it had been subjected to â€˜â€˜much brickbatsâ€™â€™.

The Bench issued notices to IGLâ€™s managing director A K Dey and his predecessor, Rajeev Sharma, and two top officials, Vincent Lobo and P S Bhargava, for misleading the court and thus to show cause why â€˜â€˜appropriate action should not be taken against him and others for having misled this court in passing various ordersâ€™â€™.

IGLâ€™s counsel P Chidambaram said the demand of CNG calculated by the Union government and other agencies at 16.11 lakh kg per day was erroneous and grossly exaggerated. The Bench asked the Centre to inform it â€˜â€˜as to what steps can be taken to ensure full and proper dispensation of CNG to the transport sector without there being any queue at the CNG stationsâ€™â€™.

The Bench said: â€˜â€˜Today for the first time on the basis of an affidavit by IGL, this court is sought to be informed, though not in very clear and explicit terms, that compression capacity and dispensation capacity of a station dispensing gas are two different things.â€™â€™ Various affidavits were filed on behalf of IGL, assuring the court it would be able to meet the demands of the transport sector but it did not have enough supply, it said.

20,Former MP Dhote forms new party,"NAGPUR: Former MP Jambuwantrao Dhote on Monday announced the formation of a political party â€” the Vidarbha Janata Congress (VJC) â€” dedicated to the formation of Vidarbha state.

After its launch, the VJC will hold a public rally at Chitnavis Park here on January 23, and take a vow to fight for Vidarbha. A rathyatra will be taken out in the region to â€œawakenâ€� people, followed by a Nagpur-Delhi march.

21,"Consultation delays policy decisions, says L-G","NEW DELHI: Explaining the reasons behind the delay in clearing files on crucial administrative matters of Delhi, lieutenant-governor Vijai Kapoor said on Monday that it was because the process of resolving differences with the state on such issues was â€˜tardyâ€™.

â€˜â€˜Though I have the constitutional power to send files on all such matters to the Centre, where there is a difference of opinion with the elected state government, I have never done that. I try to resolve disputes through consultation. As the process is time-consuming, the decisions on such administrative matters get delayed,â€™â€™ Kapoor said.

Kapoor said on important administrative matters he often sought explanations from the related departments, leading to more delays. Kapoor cited examples of five major administrative decisions which were delayed because of these reasons.

He said decision on revision of fare for public transport was delayed because he wanted to ensure that Delhi cabinetâ€™s proposal was in compliance with the observations of the Supreme Court on price of CNG.

As the L-G ascertained that, the implementation of the revised fares were delayed by a week. Another administrative delay which caused a major political controversy was laying of CNG pipeline in west Delhi which was crucial to expanding the CNG distribution network in west Delhi. Kapoor had raised objections to the proposals on the ground that cutting the Ring Road would have caused traffic disruptions.

An alternative route was proposed by the Delhi Development Authority in December last year. Kapoor said he gave approval to Indraprastha Gas Limited to start work on two segments. According to Kapoor, for the remaining segments, he had to persuade Defence authority to allow the pipeline through Delhi Cantonment, which finally came through in July this year.

More recently, there was a stand-off between L-G and Dikshit government on construction of a flyover from Lajpat Nagar to Ashram.

Refusing to accept Kapoorâ€™s proposal on modifying the construction plan for this flyover, the Delhi Tourism and Development Corporation last week decided to go ahead with their original plan.

22,Muslims on yatra route hold nervous protests,"EN ROUTE THE GAURAV YATRA: Muslims along the route of the gaurav yatra â€” into its second day on Monday â€” reacted in different ways as chief minister Narendra Modi traversed towns and villages of north Gujarat.

While some just closed their shops and confined themselves to their homes, others came out on to the streets, raising slogans against what they termed as â€˜â€˜rubbing salt on injuriesâ€™â€™.

In Kalol, hundreds of members of the minority community came out in the Bada Kasba and Matva Kuva areas. They were irked by the fact that the police had forcibly pulled down the shutters of about 200 shops owned by them.

The police were on the edge during the demonstration. As one of the most vocal demonstrators led the slogan-shouting, a police inspector warned him sternly: â€˜â€˜You stop this or I will book you under Tada.â€™â€™

Modi, seemingly nonplussed by the protests, just waved to the protesters as if they were his supporters. In Himmatnagarâ€™s RTO area, however, Muslims establishments along the roadside were closed, with most of the shopkeepers huddled together with their families at home. â€˜â€˜We just want this to pass, we donâ€™t want any trouble, â€˜â€™ said one of them.
