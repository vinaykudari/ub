2,State govt committed to terror law,"gandhinagar: the bjp government here is committed to implement the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) ""strictly"" in the state. this is in view of the state sharing a long border with pakistan, making it vulnerable to smuggling of arms and ammunition, narcotics and even infiltration via the rann of kutch. minister of state for home gordhanbhai zadaphia, who returned here after a two-day tour of border areas of kutch, told tnn, ""a deterrent act like poto is the need of the hour when the country is faced with a twin menace of terrorism and religious extremism."" zadaphia said that poto has been enacted after a prolonged debate on combat programme against increasing activities of terrorists and fundamentalists, who are out to destabilise the nation, and therefore a sustained campaign supported by a strong legal framework was required. to educate people about the provisions of the ordinance, the ruling party has organised a series of programmes in big cities. this is a part of the nation-wide campaign launched by bjp, which was convinced that poto was the only law which could effectively deal with terrorism. expressing surprise over the hue and cry being raised by the opposition congress, zadaphia said, ""it was the congress which first introduced tada, and after its gross misuse in the 1990s, was forced to scrap it up following strong criticism of the act from various quarters, and so in these circumstances they have no moral right to oppose poto."" secondly, the congress was hooked up with appeasing the minorities and therefore, perhaps party leaders were opposing poto completely. but, instead of protesting, the congress should build its opinion after consulting the party's legal experts, who were secretly favouring the provisions of poto to handle terrorism, he said. lashing out at the congress for its doublespeak on the act, the minister said at national level the congress was opposing poto while in some states like maharashtra where congress is in power, acts like maharashtra prevention of organised crimes has been enacted to firmly deal with mafia gangs. while referring to the pros and cons of the ordinance that is yet to be introduced in the parliament, zadaphia said, ""poto is a must to win the battle against terrorism, and even law commission of india has suggested the need for such a law."" to a query whether the state government would go for a separate legislation if poto is not passed by the parliament, the minister said, ""it is too early to comment on this issue at this stage."" the minister said the state government would set up designated courts for implementation of poto, which is meant for checking all types of terrorism. those harbouring terrorists, and even those possessing illegal arms and ammunition will not be spared from the dragnet of this law, he added. meanwhile, the first phase of the public campaign in favour of poto undertaken by the bjp in the state on sunday evoked good response at meetings held in six cities including ahmedabad, vadodara, surat, rajkot, bhavnagar and jamnagar.

17,Traders divided over bandh call,"lucknow: the traders call for a complete bandh in the city on tuesday took a political hue causing confusion on monday as conflicting signals came from traders associations owing allegiance to the bjp and the samajwadi party. striking entirely different postures, the lucknow vyapar mandal and the up yuva udyog vyapar mandal (upyuvm) criticised each other, with one saying that the shops would not be closed and the latter maintaining that all shop-keepers in the state capital would indeed down their shutters. reacting to the call given by the traders leader banwari lal kanchal not to participate in the bandh call, sandeep bansal, the state president of the upyuvm told times news network on monday that he would desist from commenting upon kanchal ""since some misguided elements were trying to divide the traders"" and added that ""their bandh call would prove their might on tuesday"". the call for closing of all shops comes in wake of the murder of a prominent jeweller of kanpur in the city earlier this month. it was claimed that all shops and petrol pumps in the state capital would remain closed till 2:00 pm on november 20 as a mark of protest against the police inability to solve the case. on the eve of the bandh, however, it appeared that the bandh call has become a show of strength between the rival factions of traders. and not surprisingly both the factions led by kanchal and bansal in an effort to show how they have drummed up support in and against the bandh call trumpeted statements from various affiliated organisations in their favour. banwari lal kanchal, however, maintained that all shops would remain open and declared that in case the killers of roop chandra agarwal were not nabbed before november 28 all traders would take to the streets and air their resentment against the government and the police. ""since the ssp has sought a week's time, we see no reason to disbelieve the efforts the police have been making to bring the guilty to book,"" he said.

18,PM to BJP: See terror law through,"new delhi: prime minister atal behari vajpayee has directed the bjp parliamentary party to ""neutralise"" all opposition attempts to destabilise the government's attempts to pass the prevention of terrorism ordinance in parliament. the prime minister said that the opposition to poto was politically motivated. vajpayee's logic was: when the whole world has woken up to global terrorism and india itself suffers from cross-border terrorism, it's a shame that the indian government would not have a law to combat terrorism effectively. the prime minister also added that there was an inverse correlation between terrorism and a country's development and that the country was committed in fighting terrorism. he also said that india has strongly rejected the arcane and unproductive definitions of international and state sponsored terrorism by the united nations. ""terrorism is a threat to the civilised world"", he said. india, he said, also called upon the international community to summon the necessary political will to ensure that all funding and safe havens are totally denied to terrorists everywhere. vajpayee's statement at the parliament indicate the seriousness with which the bjp and its principal allies are viewing poto. political observers commented that even as the nda government was trying to have a consensus on poto, the congress-led opposition's resistance to poto could potentially destabilise the government's efforts. importantly, bjp and its allies do not have the required majority in the rajya sabha. therefore, it's almost certain that poto would be blocked at the rajya sabha - even if gets cleared at the lok sabha. observers said if the government was unable to master support for poto even after the all-party meeting, convening a joint session at parliament could be the only way by which poto can be passed. nda convenor george fernandes had said that monday's nda meeting did not discuss the possibility of holding a joint session of parliament to ratify poto. the government's current stand on the matter was only after parliament's consultative committee of home ministry, chaired by lal krishna advani, discuss poto on november 23, the all party meeting on poto would be held.

22,Govt talks of joint session on terror law,"new delhi: with a meeting ground on the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance seeming more elusive by the day, the government is busy making calculations for a showdown in a joint sitting of parliament. though government sources claimed on tuesday that a joint session had not really been discussed yet by the nda, he reeled off figures to show that in a joint sitting of houses, the new terror law would be passed. talking about the national democratic alliance strategy on the ordinance, the sources said the government was counting on the support of jayalalithaa's aiadmk -- which has already favoured it - and the nationalist congress party. if a joint session votes on the ordinance, of the 782 members, nda, tdp, aiadmk and ncp would account for 433, while the entire opposition would have 349, mahajan said. a joint session could be required for the ordinance to be passed as the nda and tdp have 309 seats in the lok sabha, but 92 in the rajya sabha, where they are in minority. the bill is thus sure to be defeated when it comes up for ratification in the upper house. a joint sitting of both houses can only be called by the president if a bill has been passed by one house but rejected by the other; if the houses disagree on amendments to be made; or if more than six months elapse from the date of reception of the bill by the other house without it being passed. a joint session has been held only on two previous occasions - in 1961 on the dowry prohibition bill and in 1978 on the banking service commission repeal bill. it is, however, also clear that there has been a climbdown in the government's rigid stance on the issue. echoing the prime minister's words at a bjp parliamentary party meeting earlier in the day, the sources said: ""we are firm on bringing the bill. but changes can be made."" stressing that the government would try for consensus, they pointed out that though the opposition had voiced protests, nobody had made specific demands, save on the clause on the media. the sources denied that an all-party meeting called on tuesday had been cancelled, saying in fact no meeting had been called. an all-party meeting on the issue would be held only in the end of november or first week of december, after the home ministry consultative committee had discussed the matter. the government sources dismissed senior cpm leader somnath chatterjee's assertion that the bjp would stall for time and allow the ordinance to lapse without bringing it in house. chatterjee, addressing reporters, said the entire opposition was united in its stand against the ""draconian"" ordinance. ""our opposition is total, there is no difference of opinion."" he accused the government of using the issue for political expediency with an eye on the up elections. the bjp leveled the same charge at the opposition. prime minister atal bihari vajpayee told a parliamentary party meeting early on tuesday that the ordinance was being opposed with a political motive, pointing out that the congress had taken stricter measures during its reign. exhorting the bjp members to work towards neutralising the opposition to the ordinance, vajpayee said they should try for a consensus, as the country should not be divided. briefing reporters, party spokesman v k malhotra said the prime minister hoped the bill would be passed by both houses. the prime minister said provisions in the ordinance could be amended or removed, but it couldn't be said that no such act was needed. stressing that business in parliament should not be held up, he said beyond that they were ready for any argument on both the anti-terror ordinance and the re-induction of george fernandes, the other issue that stirred a storm in the house on tuesday. the prime minister has defended the reinstatement, saying there is ""no accusation against fernandes and there never was any"". the opposition is up in arms on the issue, saying it was a blatant attempt to divert the attention of the judicial commission of inquiry set up to look into the matter. attempting to corner the government during zero hour after the prime minister had made a statement on his recent three-nation tour, congress chief whip priya ranjan das munshi asked vajpayee to explain his conduct in re-inducting fernandes. the entire opposition led by the congress then walked out dissatisfied with the government's response. das munshi said the congress was now examining the possibility of bringing a censure motion on the issue. meanwhile, the defiance of supreme court orders by the vishwa hindu parishad at the ayodhya temple will now be discussed by the lok sabha on monday. speaker gmc balayogi on tuesday rejected the adjournment motion moved by the congress, left parties, rashtriya janata dal and samajwadi party on ayodhya as the matter was subjudice. he referred the matter to the business advisory committee, which decided on a discussion in house on monday. the issue was similarly referred by the rajya sabha to the business advisory committee. the bjp has expressed surprise at the opposition move on the issue. it said the status quo had been maintained as ordered by the supreme court. malhotra said, ""no law was broken and the opposition is doing this just with an eye on the up elections."" on wednesday, a discussion on farmers' plight will be taken up. the prime minister' statement on his three-nation tour is likely to be discussed next week.

23,3 lose sight after surgery in govt eye camp,"guwahati: in yet another instance of negligence in the health department, 22 people were infected - including three who are reported to be in a very critical condition and may lose their eyesight permanently - after undergoing operation in a government sponsored eye camp. according to assam health minister dr bhumidar barman, the condition of three patients chittaranjan mandal, 65, sarla sarkar, 65 and kumbh bala kalita, 65, is in an irreversible condition though he has ordered best treatment for those admitted in the government medical college and hospital (gmch) in the institute of ophthalmology. since november 9, the institute has admitted 21 patients with eye infection following treatment at the eye camp. besides the three who may have lost their sight forever, dr deepak bhuyan, assistant professor at the institute, said the conditions of the others could deteriorate further. he, however, maintained that ""as of now some of them are showing improvement after being put under constant watch and medication."" bhuyan informed that a cataract camp was organised in maloibari village, kamrup district, from november 2-7 where 47 people with cataract were operated on. a couple of days later problems surfaced and the victims reported to the gmch. when the number of those infected reached an alarming number, the institute admitted all of them. the eye camp was held under the national programme for control of blindness in association with a local ngp samidhan goshthi and district blindness control society of kamrup and all of them were operated on november 3. talking about the conditions in the camp, he admitted that though they hold large number of such camps in the state from september to march, it is very rare that they get perfect operating conditions. but on the other hand bhuyan pointed out that these camps have to be held in rural areas in accordance with the national programme and the operations carried out in the best available conditions in the area. earlier this month, in yet another tragic incident 16 children lost their lives after being administered vitamin a in a statewide programme.

24,UTI will offload investments to boost US-64 NAV,"mumbai: with just one more month to go before uti declares the net asset value of its flagship us-64 scheme, efforts are on to boost the nav of the units prior to the declaration on january 1, 2002. some of these measures include booking profits from equity investments and transferring rs 872 crore from the development reserve fund (drf) to the us-64 scheme on account of the latter's real estate holdings. ''we have already exited from a few corporates through negotiation and are currently talking to a few others. uti has also exercised its options to exit from select investments made in multinational companies by participating in their open offers to increase stakes in indian operations. simultaneously, we are talking to other financial institutions about whether they are willing to take over assets that we hold in some companies. nothing has been finalised on this front,'' said uti chairman m damodaran. uti has identified around 32 companies where its entire equity investments will be divested to book profits, which the chairman hinted involves even ''companies where uti has large holdings''. damodaran added that over two- thirds of real estate holdings in us-64 have already been transferred to liquid assets by transferring them. as part of this process, the drf has transferred over rs 620 crore towards the scheme, which the chairman said would benefit the scheme. ''before december 31, all the real estate assets—estimated at rs 850 crore—will be transferred to the trust,'' he added. on the debt-to-equity ratio of us-64, a uti spokesperson said that as on date, in terms of market value, equity investments amount to 61.5 per cent and debt investments 38.5 per cent. this, analysts said, is substantially down from over 70 per cent four months back. though market analysts opine that the nav would be in the range of rs 7-8 per unit, the chairman refused to divulge any details on this. however, uti officials said that fund managers have been instructed to offload equity substantially on the eve of the nav conversion. damodaran said that the trust was considering the recommendations of the recently-submitted malegam committee report and added that a majority of investors were against them. ''we have had extensive discussions with various stakeholders of the trust, which primarily included individual investors. these investors were totally against the committee recommendation to offload 60 per cent equity in the sponsoring company to a strategic investor,'' he added. the uti board is meeting in december to finalise its stance on the malegam panel report, which will then be presented to the government for approval.

25,KRRS finds neera policy inconsistent,"mysore: karnataka rajya raitha sangha (krrs) (puttannaiah faction) chief k.s. puttannaiah on tuesday took strong objection to the reintroduction of the ban on neera tapping in the state for three months following the steps taken to control the mite menace. criticising chief minister s.m. krishna he said ``there seems to be no consistency in the chief minister's decisions''. at a press meet here, he said this is the first government in the state which changes its decisions faster than the railways changing tracks and there is no wisdom in the decisions taken by the government. ""one day the government announces that it has allowed neera tapping and a few days later it suddenly changes the decision,"" he said, adding there is some external factor which is forcing this government to behave so. singling out the excise lobby, he said in case of neera tapping, it is the excise lobby which is forcing the state government to ban neera tapping. he suggested krishna do a rethink on the matter before arriving at a decision. puttannaiah added the farmers will not heed to the agriculture minister's cry on banning neera tapping and said the farmers will take on the government on this issue and will not succumb to the pressure tactics. condemning the violence unleashed by the hired goons of the excise contractors in connivance with the excise department officials to check neera tapping, the krrs chief said, ``now the farmers have decided to take law into their hands and punish the goondas who attack them''. ""let the government take action against the farmers. we will see how the police will come to us,"" he challenged and said the farmers are determined to tap neera and take on the might of the excise contractors. the farmers leader also disclosed that farmers all over the state will stage a dharna in front of the kptcl which is trying to fix meters to supply power to the pumpsets. ""it is an unending war of farmers against the kptcl and the government is discriminating between the rural and urban people.'' urging the government to constitute a committee to work out a policy on power consumption by the farmers and categorise land according to their irrigation needs, he said: ""this will help the farmers in conservation of both water and power."" he also urged the government to give a 100 per cent subsidy to the farmers who opt for sprinkler or drip irrigation systems. puttannaiah, who condemned the government's attitude towards the sugarcane farmers of kuntur sugar factory area, said the government should immediately disclose the facts about who owns the sugar factory, besides making arrangements to pay the farmers their dues which have run into more than rs 10 crore.

26,Unemployed B.Ed graduates take out rally,"bellary: hundreds of members of bellary zilla nirudhyoga b.ed. graduates association on tuesday held a protest rally against the indifference of the government to their demands. the members who assembled at the durgamma temple, took out a procession through the main thoroughfares and submitted a memorandum addressed to the chief minister at the dc's office. the rally led by district unit president g. hullapppa and secretary b. siddappa criticised the government for its step-motherly treatment towards the teaching community graduates, without taking any concrete steps to resolve their long-pending demands. they said the gulbarga division in north karnataka was a far backward region in the sector of education and recorded as sociallybackward and economically weak in the region and hence needed government attention. the government was contemplating special schemes on one side to develop the region and on the other hand, the same government was depriving employment to people of this region. the unemployed b.ed. graduates highlighted the failures of the government in their memorandum and demanded they be set right immediately in order to provide justice to the deprived. they said in the recent state-level high school teachers selection, there were a number of lapses. a teacher had been elected in more than one division as the selection of high school teachers was conducted at state-level in each division. there was no systematic and equal yardstick adopted in calling high school teachers for the posts as different universities had different types of maximum marks and this deprived the chances of getting selected students of some regions. highest number of dharwad region students had got selected, as there was no coordination committee for internal assessment to gauge the student'sperformance by giving internal marks. this deprived the chances to other university students. but what was ironical was that from gulbarga division, which comprises of five districts, only five per cent of the 533 candidates who applied for the post got selected. it was astonishing that esamma, a rank holder in b.ed in the year 1999 from gulbarga university, didn't get selected for the posts due to several lapses in the system they said. the association warned the government to set right the system and make a way for gulbarga division students to get selected for the posts applied not only in the teaching sector but also for other posts before the students took to streets. they demanded that the government should immediately scrap the teachers selection list released by it as the selection was not systematic and scientific. the teachers must be selected on lines of cet by conducting examinations even at divisional level. even for the higher primary schools, the b.ed students must be selected and only the external marks should be considered while assessing the performance of the student. government must implement common curriculum for b.ed courses for the entire state and should immediately recruit people for the vacant headmaster posts in the state.

27,Plastic use: KSIA to implement central rule in DK,"mangalore: the kanara small industries association (ksia) here has decided to strictly implement the central guidelines regarding plastic bags and its use in dakshina kannada. this was decided at the meeting of dakshina kannada and udupi plastic manufacturers association, called under the auspices of ksia here recently. they have also requested the public to cooperate with them. jayaraj pai, president of ksia, said any violation in the above matter may be brought to the notice of the deputy commissioner or pollution control board officials. it may be recalled that the plastic manufacturers and vendors here had been directed by the deputy commissioner to comply with the provisions of the recycled plastics manufacture and usage rules, 1999, under the provisions of the environment (protection) act of 1986, and warned that violation of the rule would attract severe penal action. deputy commissioner a.k. monnappa had said, according to the rules, the plastic carry bags and containers made of virgin plastic should be in natural shade or white and the containers used for purposes other than storing and packaging food stuff should be manufactured by using pigments and colourants as per is: 9833: 1981. regarding recycling, the dc said, it should be undertaken according to the norms prescribed by the bureau of indian standards. apart from this, the recycled plastics should carry code/mark as per bis specifications and the product should be marked `virgin/recycled' along with the indication of percentage of recycled material. on penal action, the dc said, on violation of the rule, the industry will be closed down along with stoppage of power and water supply or any other service, along with imprisonment for a term of five years and a fine of rs 1 lakh or both. if the violation continues, additional fine of rs 5,000 per day after conviction would be imposed.

28,"Govt for effective policing, not terror law","patna: the bihar government has strongly protested the promulgation of the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and suggested that the centre strengthen security measures on the sprawling indo-nepal border on the bihar side and also provide adequate central assistance. labour minister upendra prasad verma, while participating in the meeting of chief ministers on internal security convened by prime minister vajpayee recently, informed it that before rushing through the ordinance in parliament, the centre should place the matter for national debate. the bill is ""draconian in its present form and the bihar government will not implement it like this,"" he said. on his return, verma, who represented chief minister rabri devi in the meeting, said here on monday that the state government had forcefully placed facts while opposing the poto. ""there are various stringent laws already existing to counter terrorism. the poto is draconian and infringes on civil liberties and human rights of people,"" verma told the meeting, adding that there is a serious apprehension among people that it will be misused to serve political interests. verma said that he had conveyed strong reservations of the bihar government in the meeting. he insisted that sections like 3, 5(2), 7(1), 14, 16, and 48(7) ""infringe personal liberty"". the state government, he said, had made fervent plea to withdraw this ordinance with immediate effect. the poto also has ""malicious provisions restricting the press"", he added. according to verma, the bihar government, in the meeting, submitted a proposal for increasing the number of ""unified check posts"" at raxoul and jogbani on the indo-nepal border. verma pointed out at the meeting that various proposals to the tune of over rs 57 crore regarding the strengthening of security by installing police posts in the border areas and also by introducing effective policing for strict vigil have been pending with the centre for the last several years. the centre should clear the scheme for effective vigil in the border areas, he said, adding that it should give a nod to modernisation of police forces by allowing expenditure of 20 per cent on the appointment of forces. the centre should bear 75 per cent of the expenditure as central assistance and should give an additional amount to manage border security. prime minister vajpayee assured the meeting that for all these problems, an all-party meeting will be convened soon.

29,Three policemen injured in clash with tribals,"jamshedpur: a group of tribals once again on monday night clashed with the police in patamda block of the east singhbhum district in a bid to assert village self-rule passed by parliament. armed with traditional weapons, over 100 residents of the namsole village, including women and children, allegedly blocked the road and ghearoed the policemen raiding their village late in the afternoon. the raiding party led by patamda police station officer-in-charge sahay lakra was detained by the tribals for over six hours. the captured policemen were freed around midnight, after reinforcement was rushed to village. the police had to use mild force to disperse the agitating people, who retaliated by pelting stones. at least three policemen sustained minor injures, reports said. it is for the third time that the villagers have clashed with the police in the area. in september last year, residents of haludbani village had captured and humiliated former officer-in-charge s k yadav while he was allegedly stealing materials from a government warehouse. more recently, policemen were allegedly roughed up in a village for conducting a raid. this time, the trouble arose when the police went to namsole to secure the release of chowkidar subhash mahali, accused of harassing the villagers. the self-styled 'gram sabha' was holding 'court' when the police reached there on the complaint of mahali's son. the villagers objected to the police intervention on the ground that the 'gram sabha' was the supreme body, dsp s k jha. parliament had a few years ago adopted the recommendation of dilip singh bhuria committee for village self-rule in the schedule areas. the state government, however, has not set up village councils. but the residents of patamda area have on their own formed 'gram sabhas' in most of the villages. one can find sign boards of 'gram sabhas' in many villages. some voluntary groups have apparently fed the people with wrong information. they think that the village body has to look into all criminal cases and pass judgments and the police need to seek its permission to enter the village, jha said. once implemented, the new law would empower the 'gram sabhas' to hear minor cases like those under sections 323, 427 and 506 of the ipc. the police will handle all major criminal cases, jha said. meanwhile, the police have decided to lodge a case against five local liquor mafia of the area. they instigated people to clash with the police, jha said and added that an fir would also be lodged against the chowkidar and his son for harassing the villagers.

30,Local bodies dept ‘follows’ law differently,"bathinda: while the labour law authorities in punjab pretend to be striving hard to enforce the law vis-a-vis minimum wages of labourers, the decision of local bodies department while inviting tenders for services of sweepers in bathinda municipal committee on contractual basis seems to be contrary to this. even as the labour law prescribes the minimum wages for a labourer not below rs 72 per day under any circumstances, the municipal committee (bathinda) had received tenders for contractual services of 150 sweepers at the rate of rs 59 per day per labour. interestingly, while a chandigarh-based contractor had agreed to provide 150 sweepers services at rs 59 each, he had also given a written assurance not to violate labour law according to which he would pay rs 72 per day to every labourer. the contractor had also reportedly given in writing that the labourer would be provided provident fund facility and other services related benefits. but, the question residents have raised is how would the contractor pay rs 72 to each sweeper when he got rs 59 per sweeper from the bathinda municipal committee. they expressed apprehensions that this could only be possible if there is fudging of the actual number of sweepers employed, but a senior official of the municipal committee denied this. he told the times news network that the sweepers would be paid less than rs 72. and said that the contractor was bound to pay minimum wages . to a sweeper, hence the contractor would get an undertaking from a sweeper to the affect that the later was paid the given amount.

32,Relief in house tax policy likely in Haryana,"chandigarh:a house tax relief package is in the offing even as the haryana government has convened a meeting of civic body chiefs and representatives of prominent trade organisations on november 26 to know their views on the new house tax policy. the meeting, which is being described in political circles here as crucial for its outcome will ultimately determine the relief package, will be presided over by chief minister chautala. the earlier two all-party mla meetings on the issue had been presided over by minister of state for urban development subhash goyal. though the government's efforts to bring about transparency in its house tax policy have been widely lauded, the overall jump in the quantum of house tax as a result of this policy has annoyed both mlas of the ruling party and opposition. it is reliably learnt that even though the house tax amount is likely to reduce in case of 50 per cent of house owners, the average hike in case of the remaining 50 per cent is likely to be four-fold and in several cases it could be six to eight-fold. what has further unnerved the public is the decision to tax vacant plots and the application of the same formula for the assessment of all categories of houses which comprises the market value of the land and that of the building on it. the state government is now thinking in terms of exempting vacant plots from this tax besides tak- ing the value of built up area only in case of industrial plots while determining the tax amount. sources reveal that those who own four to five-marla houses are also likely to get some relief as most of the mlas have pleaded strongly for total exemption in case of the poor. the congress, which is the main opposition in the state vidhan sabha, has, however, demanded scrapping of the new policy, described it as anti-people. even the bjp, which is an ally of the ruling indian national lok dal (inld), has been highly critical of the policy which, if not suitably changed, will hit at the very roots of its urban vote bank. what has irked the chief minister the most is that instead of offering some constructive suggestions to make the policy people-friendly, the congress had preferred to boycott the all-party mlas meetings convened by the minister of state for urban development on the issue. the congress leadership complains that the government is in no mood to change the fundamentals of its new house tax policy and hence there is no point in interacting with it on the issue. it was on this issue that the party had given a call for a statewide bandh on november 2 which evoked a mixed response in most parts of the state. however, during the recent winter session, the chief minister assured the vidhan sabha that the government was genuinely interested in redressing people's grievances over the new house tax policy.

33,Relaxation for appointment of principals,"chandigarh: the punjab government has decided to give a four-year relaxation in the requirement for college teachers to have a phd in order to be considered for appointment as principals in colleges across the state. speaking to times news network, punjab minister for higher education master mohan lal confirmed that the decision had been taken by the secretary higher education, geetika kalha on november 12. a ugc notification of december 26, 1998, had made it mandatory for all aspirants to the post of principal of a college to have a doctoral degree. however, this requirement of the ugc which began with the good intention of increasing the academic standards at the higher echelons of college management, degenerated to the level of a farce as only principals with phds in subjects such as punjabi, hindi and sanskrit started getting appointed, since it was easier to do phds in these subjects as compared to subjects such as physics and chemistry amongst others. according to a college principal, at ad college,dharamkot,affiliated to pu, of the 10 candidates who applied, eight were phd in punjabi and of the remaining two did not come for the interview. at sant darbara singh college, lopon, near moga, there were about seven applicants and all were phds, either in punjabi or sanskrit.two appeared for the interview and they were both phd in sanskrit. incidentally, the state council for higher education (sche) had already approved at its last meeting that the ugc requirement should be deferred as it was counter productive. the pu senate in may this year had also unanimously passed a resolution moved by principal ps sangha, which sought a four-year relaxation. a university official said colleges were losing out in getting good administrators from the science streams because of the ugc stipulation. ''we are not undermining people who have done phd in language subjects. however, it is a fact that a senior professor of physics might find it difficult to do a phd at an advanced stage of his career.

35,Terror law may be tabled in House by Dec 7,"new delhi: faced with opposition to poto in its present form - both from its political rivals and allies - the government strategy appears to be to introduce it towards the end of the third week of the five-week parliament session - that is by december 7. this, government sources said, is for two reasons: that negative publicity about poto does not overshadow the session and prevent the government from fulfilling the rest of its agenda; it gives the government enough time to work on what it perceives as divisions within the congress to its own advantage. the bjp's target clearly is the congress. a senior bjp minister said, ""the left parties, the samajwadi party and the rashtriya janata dal are clear that they will oppose poto. but as far as the congress is concerned, there is some ambivalence - there is a gap between its chief ministers and the central leadership. both maharashtra and karnataka are, for instance, not fundamentally opposed to poto. we want to see whether they will be able to influence the congress central leaders."" simultaneously, the government has also floated the idea of bringing the bill to a joint sitting of parliament under article 108 of the constitution, in case it fails to muster support in rajya sabha. government sources pointed out that with the backing of the aiadmk and the nationalist congress party, which are officially not allies of the nda, it would have the support of 433 mps as against 349 of the opposition. asked how serious the government is about using this provision, used only twice before in india's parliamentary history, a senior minister said, ""at the moment, it is only an academic discussion."" but bjp sources added that the purpose of getting a discussion going on a joint sitting was more to assess whether poto really had as much public support as the government would like it to have. sources close to the pm said, ""we don't want to bring a joint sitting merely to humiliate the opposition. we want to be convinced that the people really want it and that the opposition's objections are out of sync with the public mood.""

36,PM may convene all-party meet on terror law,"new delhi: prime minister vajpayee may convene an all-party meeting in the first week of december in a bid to evolve a consensus on the controversial prevention of terrorism ordinance. the pm said that the opposition was opposing it for political reasons. addressing the bjp parliamentary party meeting here on tuesday, vajpayee said it was imperative to have such a legislation to tackle terrorism and the government was prepared to clear any misgivings the opposition may have. vajpayee was hopeful that the bill would get parliamentary approval. briefing newsmen on the meeting, party spokesman v k malhotra quoted the pm as saying that the situation had changed since the september 11 attacks in new york and washington and therefore it was necessary to have laws to check terrorism. meanwhile, the government on tuesday sent mixed signals on poto. it said that it was no mood to rush through the legislation, but at the same time, gave indications of convening a joint session of parliament to get the ordinance passed if the rajya sabha does not clear it. the nda is in a minority in the rajya sabha. with the aiadmk and the ncp supporting poto, the government is expecting support from 433 of the 782 members of both houses. the opposition votes may add up to 349. under the constitution, a joint sitting of both houses can be held if a bill passed by one house is rejected by the other house or if the houses disagree on amendments to be made in the bill. sources said that the government may consider amending certain provisions in the ordinance. a clause which makes it mandatory for an accused to be produced before the magistrate 48 hours after his arrest could be amended. the 48-hour period could be reduced to 24 hours. at tuesday's meeting of the business advisory committee of the lok sabha, the government was of the view that an all-party meeting on poto should be held only after the parliamentary consultative committee attached to the home ministry meets to discuss the issue on november 23.
