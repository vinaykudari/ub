0,Marad violence: BJP to intensify agitation for CBI probe,"KOZHIKODE: The BJP''s Kerala unit on Thursday said it would intensify its agitation across the state to press for a CBI probe into the Marad violence that claimed nine lives on May 2 and said the party''s state council at Kochi would chalk out the proposed action.

""BJP will launch a statewide protest following its two-day state council meet at Kochi from July 26 and not relent till government agrees for a CBI enquiry into the incident,"" BJP state President C K Padmanabhan told reporters here.

Asserting that only a probe by the Central investigating agency could bring out the real facts behind the massacre, he said the government could no more shy away from ordering the probe as the demand was now being made from several quarters, including an ally of the ruling UDF.

The government should also offer Rs 10 lakh compensation to the kin of those killed, he said.

He alleged ""false"" cases were being booked against some of the party''s members in connection with the matter.

On VHP leader Pravin Togadia''s recent visit to Marad and his alleged remarks that the parishad would not allow rehabilitation of families of minority community in the area, he said, though the BJP also felt time was not ripe for initiating the process of rehabilitation, he would not comment on the VHP''s stand.

1,SFI protests against govt's education policy,"KOZHIKODE: National Students Federation of India on Thursday threatened to intensify its agitation across Kerala if the UDF government failed to amend its ""anti-student education policy.""

Addressing a press meet here, All-India SFI General Secretary Kallol Roy said the federation would carry on its agitation till such time the government changed the education policy to suit all classes, including socially and economically backward.

Claiming the ""anti-student"" education policies were also pursued by several other state governments, Roy said, ""this only led to corruption as it gives prominence to self-financing institutions.""

Urging the BJP-led NDA government to initiate necessary steps to enact a suitable legislation in the next session of Parliament to ensure socially and economically-backward classes in the country are not deprived the ""fruits of higher education"", he said that the SFI would take out a march for the cause.

2,RSS protests implication of its leaders in false cases,"KOCHI: The Kerala unit of the RSS on Thursday protested against alleged attempts to foist false cases against leaders of the Hindu organisations who were spearheading agitations to project the demands of the affected Hindu families at Marad.

False criminal cases were allegedly being registered against prominent leaders of the Hindu Aikyavedi and RSS for addressing public meetings, A R Mohanan, RSS Prantha Karyavah, said in a release here on Thursday.

The chief minister, who was also holding the home portfolio should make clear whether these actions were taken with his knowledge and consent.

The government attempt to put down the agitations with the help of police would only complicate the situation, he cautioned.

Alleging that even after two months of the incident at Marad, the government had not shown any sincere attempt to nab the people behind the killing, he said.

In the incident on May 2, nine people lost their lives.

Reiterating their the demand for a CBI probe into the Marad massacre, he said even official agencies were demanding for such a probe.

In these circumstances, the chief minister should give up his adamant stand and take steps to hand over the enquiry to CBI, he added.

3,HC directs govt to restore 20 acres of evergreen forest,"KOCHI: A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the state government and forest department to initiate steps to take possession of 20 acres of evergreen forest at Mundanad in Mannarkad taluk in Palakaad district.

The evergreen forests had to be restored from one Hamsa Haji, who had allegedly obtained the land ""by fraud"" and by ""suppressing"" material facts before the forest tribunal.

The direction was issued by the Bench, comprising Justice K S Radhakrishnan and Justice K Padmanabhan Nair, while allowing three review petitions filed by the state government and the ''Niyamavedi'', a lawyers organisation, requesting not to transfer the forest land to Haji.

The Bench held that what had been handed over to the applicant was not the cultivating land he had claimed, but the forest.

Haji had approached a tribunal seeking exemption of 20 acre land from the Private Forest Vesting and Assignment Act, claiming it was cultivating land.

The tribunal granted the applicant''s plea against which the government moved the high court.

Setting aside the tribunal''s award, the Bench directed the state to take immediate steps to take possession of the land.

6,Banks plan farmland auction,"BATHINDA: Even as resentment is palpable among farmers of the area after clashes between members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Ekta), authorities of primary agriculture development banks (PADB) and the police last month over the arrest of 12-odd farmers for their failure to return loans, the bank officials are planning to auction the land of some defaulter farmers this week.

To recover Rs 5.88 crore in loans from 2000 farmers in 74 villages of Rampura Phool block, the bank authorities have prepared a list of about 100 defaulting farmers, whose land would be auctioned this month.

In the first phase, the authorities have issued notice to eight farmers, one of them a senior Akali leader, for the auction of their agricultural land between July 15 to July 18.

The names of the farmers are Jugraj Singh of Ghumti Kalan, Darshan Singh of Jeond, Gurpreet Singh and Jaswant Singh of Pirkot, Kanwaljeet Singh, Bachitar Singh of Burj and Bhola Nath of Chotian who owned the bank Rs 94,511, Rs 44,425, Rs 3,97,715, Rs 4,78,695, Rs 1,63,405, Rs 94,250 and Rs 1,16,312, respectively.

Besides, the bank authorities are procuring the arrest warrants of about 75 defaulting farmers of the area, which is bound to lead to another confrontation between BKU members, bank officials and police.

Though the bank officials said that the farmers would be provided adequate time and three chances to return loan before executing the arrest warrants, but BKU leaders have already alerted their members to protest against this move.

In the last month alone, there were a number of incidents of detention of banks officials by BKU members in villages of Bathinda when the former went to the villages for auctioning the land or executing the arrest warrants of defaulting farmers.

Every time, the police had to interfere and use mild force to release the bank officials. After some farmers were arrested, the BKU members laid siege to the PADBâ€™s Nathana branch, detaining the entire bank staff, who were released only after the district administration assured the release.

7,Nine injured in clash over cutting of cow's ears,"DHARAMSALA: Santoshgarh town in Una district of Himachal Pradesh was reported to be tense, on Thursday, after nine persons were injured in a clash between members of two communities.

The town is located on the banks of the Swan river close to Nangal town of Punjab.

Trouble began late on Wednesday evening when some persons allegedly chopped off the ears of a cow which happened to stray into the fields owned by them.

Heated exchanges led to clashes. Some hutments were also set ablaze.

Eight of the injured, undergoing treatment at the Una civil hospital, are reported to be out of danger.

One man, who was seriously injured, has been shifted to the PGI at Chandigarh. The cow is under treatment at the veterinary hospital.

Satwant Atwal Trivedi, superintendent of police, Una, said that eight persons had been arrested and the situation was under control.

Prem Singh, additional director-general of police, law and order, Shimla, said the district police had been directed to keep a close watch on the situation.

Parmesh Sharma, president of the nagar panchayat of Santoshgarh, and other local leaders has urged the people to maintain communal harmony.

Handsome profits: People of a particular community take land on hire during the monsoon season at Santoshgarh â€” which lies close to the main tributary of Swan river and is considered a fertile area â€” to grow vegetables.

Profits are handsome as the produce is sold in different parts of the country.

That, sources in the administration said, might well have been a cause for simmering discontent that, on Wednesday, manifested itself in violence.

8,Finance ministry evolves new transfer policy,"NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Thursday announced a new transfer policy for Group A tax officials following the recent ``cash-for-posting'''' scandal in the ministry that led to the resignation of minister of state for revenue, Gingee Ramachandran.

The new policy envisages that all transfer orders will be issued by April 30 every year. There are two Central revenue boards - the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC). The policy provides for all transfers to be effected by or on the recommendations of a specially-constituted placement committee headed by the chairman of the board with member, personnel, one member of the board to be nominated by the chairman as its member and the joint secretary as the member secretary.

Although the transfer policy is clearly in response to the recent scandal, the ministry is touting it as an initiative towards tax reforms, including reforms of the tax administration.

The ministry said it had conducted a thorough review of the existing system of transfers and postings as part of the tax reforms initiatives with emphasis on greater transparency and minimising discretion.

Under the new transfer policy, for commissioners and chief commissioners/directors-general, the placement committee will submit transfer proposals for the approval of the finance minister through the revenue secretary. This clearly removes any role by the minister of state in charge of the revenue department in effecting transfers.

Further, for all officers below the rank of commissioner, the placement committee has been authorised to place officers at the disposal of chief commissioners (in the case of CBDT) and commissioners/directors-general (in the case of CBEC) for further posting.

Like in the case of foreign service, all stations have been categories as `A'', `B'' and `C'' for the tax officials. This was a suggestion that was mooted by the adviser to the finance minister Vijay Kelkar to ensure fairness and equity in postings. The continuous stay of an officer will not exceed six years in class `A'' station, four years in class `B'' station and two years in class `C'' station.

Similarly, all posts are proposed to be categorised as either ``sensitive'''' or ``non-sensitive'''' with the stipulation that the normal tenure of an officer on sensitive posts should not exceed three years. The policy also provides for mandatory rotation between classes of stations and between sensitive and non-sensitive posts.

The policy takes into account compassionate and humane considerations like requests for postings on medical grounds and postings for working couples. At the same time, to fulfil the commitment towards probity in public services, the policy provides for restriction on posting to class `A'' station if the Central Vigilance Commission has recommended initiation of proceedings.

9,CPI urges all-party meet on Rajolibanda,"HYDERABAD: The CPI has asked the state government call for an all-party meet the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme to arrive at a solution to the problem.

CPI secretary S Sudhakar Reddy, addressing journalists Thursday, accused the chief minister of backing leaders in Rayalaseema who were behind the RDS issue.

He said TDP leaders in the region were responsible for RDS flare-up and added that the appeal by the TDP asking other political parties to instigate farmers in Mahabubnagar and Kurnool was â€œsurprisingâ€�.

He asked the government strive for the formation of authority consisting of Central Water Commission members and irrigation engineers from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

10,"Pay up for a PAN card, rules I-T dept","HYDERABAD: The days of getting a free permanent account number (PAN) for income tax assessment are over, thanks to the outsourcing model being followed by the income tax department to process the PAN card.

The I-T department has selected UTI Investor Services Ltd (UTIISL) for processing the PAN applications.

Until now the I-T department officials were processing the applications received for PAN card and issuing the card, all free-of-cost. But the department, in some of the regions in the country, was unable to process the huge number of applications and as a result the pending applications were mounting.

In order to clear the pending forms, the department has now pressed UTIISL into action.

Now, assessees have to purchase an application for PAN for Rs 5. Then pay another Rs 60 for a ticket that has to be pasted on the application. â€œUTIISL will deliver the PAN card at the applicantâ€™s doorstep within 15 working days,â€� I-T chief commissioner B P Sah said.

However, the core job of allotting the PAN number will be handled by the department. â€œUTIISL will process the application and manufacture the card once the department allots the number,â€� he said.

The UTIISL has also re-designed the card. Instead of a black-andwhite photograph, the new card will have a colour photograph of the applicant embossed on it. â€œIt also has security features like a hologram and an ultra violet line. The new card is tamper proof,â€� he said.

The I-T department has made PAN mandatory in various day to day applications like opening a bank account or getting a new vehicle registered. With this there has been an increase in the number of applications from I-T assessees seeking allotment of PAN number.

This year, even the last date for submission of income tax returns has been extended till September 30, 2003 allowing people to get a PAN card first and then submit returns. The UTIISL counters â€” at seven locations in the city â€” will accept PAN applications.

12,Contamination can't be ruled out: BMC engineer,"MUMBAI: BMC hydraulic engineer Anand Deodhar refused to comment on the Socleen study, saying he had not seen the report.MMRDA officials claimed they sent a copy of the study to the BMC several months ago.

However, Mr Deodhar said that since water supply was intermittent, and slums and garbage a continuing problem, cases of contamination could not be ruled out. â€œWhenever we get a complaint, we immediately attack it,â€™â€™ he said. Incidentally, the BMC carries out more extensive tests on water quality every year.

For the most part, the Socleen study came up with contamination percentages in line with the BMCâ€™s own estimates (8 per cent to 23 per cent), though in some areas, official figures were much lower.

14,Advani to inaugurate training camp for party MLAs,"CHANDIGARH: Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister LK Advani arrived in the city at 12.55 pm on Friday to inaugurate a three-day training camp for party MLAs hailing from five northern states of J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttranchal.

15,State govt to involve private sector in road construction,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal government is likely to take a decision soon on how to invite private sector participation in construction of roads, state PWD minister Amar Chauduri said in the state assembly on Friday in reply to a question.

The need to invite private participation had arisen because of the financial stringency through which the state government was passing, he said. The proposal had been first mooted during the presentation of this year''s state budget.

The proposal was yet to be ratified, however, by the state cabinet. But, he said the approval of the state cabinet would be available soon. After that, the modalities of private participation in road construction would be worked out.

Later, he explained to TNN that it was not possible for a government department to enter directly into partnerships with private sector firms. But, other agencies like corporations and civic bodies could do so. Whether a toll tax would have to be levied on roads built by private sector firms to make them remunerative would also have to be decided on.

Replying to a question from RSP member Tapan Hore, the minister said there was a three-year guarantee on roads constructed with loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation. Contractors of roads constructed with HUDCO loan were repairing them on their own when repair was needed within the guarantee period.

The North - South corridor project, which the state government was building along the alignment of the National Highway 34 with assistance from the Asian Development Bank was yet to get the approval of the ADB. The necessary proposals had been sent to the ADB office in Manila.

The corridor, running from Amdanga in North 24 Parganas to Raiganj in North Dinajpur, would be divided into three sectors, one stretching from Amdanga to the Nadia district, the second covering Murshidabad district up to Farakka and the third from Farakka to Raiganj. The Murshidabad stretch would be taken up first.

Pending the approval of the ADB, however, the state government was going ahead with the construction of companion state highways from Bongaon to Chakda, and to Hili and Balurghat.

Besides, 102 kms of rural roads would also be constructed by the state government, along with the corridor. Contractors had been selected for the road to Hili and some rural roads. Work orders would be issued soon.

The condition of local roads adjoining NH 2 and NH 6, which were being converted into the golden quadrilateral had turned poor in many places because of the movement of heavy vechiles carrying stones for road construction, he said.

16,CAS taking political turn in West Bengal,"KOLKATA: There are indications that the Left Front government is preparing a fresh strategy to counteract the political mileage that the BJP-led government may derive (during the forthcoming polls) through its proposal of putting a Rs 72 (plus taxes) cap on monthly cable bills. Is the CAS (Conditional Access System) saga taking a political turn in West Bengal?

Officially, CPI(M) honchos refuse to go on record about any such move being incorporated up the sleeves of the high command but off-the-record conversations reveal that specific approaches are indeed being worked out. Says a Left Front leader, ""The official line is that the state government is adopting a wait-and-watch policy. But we are trying to arrive at a consensus on how we should proceed on this issue (of CAS).

Then of course, there is the purported move by a little-known political party that has registered itself with the Election Commission of India as Jana Unnayan Mancha (JUM).

Although JUM has bagged three seats in the recently held state Panchayat elections, the party has made it clear that its claim to public fame over the coming months will be through CAS.

To kickstart its state-wide, ground-level activities JUM will convene its first-ever public forum on CAS this forthcoming Saturday where it has invited senior political leaders to share the dais with a host of prominent personalities and workers, cutting across party colours. The aim of the forum, according to JUM''s state secretary Ramanimohan Nag Chowdhury, is to protect consumer interest as the issue (of CAS) concerns policy matters involving public opinion.

The newly formed party, headed by former sheriff of Kolkata Prof. Sanat Biswas, will focus on other mass-based, political issues once the forum is over. Says Mala Banerjee, a consumer activist and one of the prime driving forces behind JUM, ""Our party (JUM) comprises of well-educated members who are engineers, doctors, scientists and the like. Our objective is to try and bring a neutral colour to the state''s electorate. And CAS will provide our first forum towards that purpose.""

Earlier, the Left Front government had made its anti-BJP stance clear when it had opposed July 15 as the implementation date for CAS. The state government''s position assumed significance at that time as West Bengal became the second state in the country (after Delhi CM Sheila Dixit''s similar line) to publicly maintain that the July 14 deadline for CAS implementation may not be possible after all.

In the final analysis with general elections scheduled next year it appears CAS is now threatening to snowball into a major political issue in the state, if not elsewhere in the country.

17,Corpus of plantation fund may be increased,"NEW DELHI: The Rs 500-crore price stabilisation fund, currently operational in the plantation sector of tea, coffee, rubber and tobacco, is likely to be enhanced.

The possibility of the increase in the corpus of the fund, through tapping the World Bank and other multilateral sources, was indicated here on Friday by Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley.

Jaitley was addressing the parliamentary standing committee attached to his ministry. Members of the committee highlighted the problems of small growers in the plantation sector, especially in South India, and wanted financial help for them to be enhanced. Swadesh Charkaborty, R S Gaval, Bali Ram Kashyap, M Master Mathan, A D K Jayaseelan, G Ramaiah and Prema Cariappa were among the members of the committee who participated in the discussion.

Jaitley explained that the fund is only a beginning and that there is a whole set of parallel measures being taken so that the difficulties facing this important sector are addressed in a holistic manner.

In response to the point raised by most members that Rs 1,000 per grower is not sufficient for providing relief, it was explained that as the corpus of the fund was limited to Rs 500 crore and it would yield an amount of between Rs 35 crore to Rs 40 crore a year based on the prevailing interest rate, it could support only 3.42 lakh growers.

18,"ONGC, BHEL in race for 51 pc govt stake in EIL","NEW DELHI: Five companies including ONGC, BHEL, L&T-GAIL combine and Sun Group of Russia are in race for acquiring 51 per cent Government stake in Engineers India Ltd, whose transaction documents have been finalised and are awaiting Cabinet approval.

""Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, L&T-GAIL combine, Sun Group, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and Soros Chatterjee Group were the only companies which went through the due diligence process,"" EIL Chairman and Managing Director M K Dalal told a news conference.

He said the transaction documents including share purchase agreement have been vetted and were waiting Cabinet approval after which financial bids would be called.

Government, which holds about 90 per cent stake in EIL, is selling 51 per cent stake to a strategic partner while another 10 per cent would be divested to employees.

Its disinvestment advisor ANZ had proposed that Government draws a special dividend of Rs 309 crore, at the rate of Rs 55 per share, from the Rs 636 crore reserves and surplus of the company, which the EIL management opposed.

""We have two major projects in hand and expect another one shortly. Execution of these would entail huge working capital requirements and if special dividend is drawn from reserves we will have to raise suppliersâ€™ credit that in turn would affect our profitability,"" EIL Director (Finance) D S Chakrabarti said.

19,WTO panel rules that US steel duties are illegal,"GENEVA: The World Trade Organisation on Friday ruled against heavy import duties on steel imposed by the US government, saying that they are illegal under global trade rules.

The 968-page decision confirmed an interim ruling issued earlier this year. It upheld complaints from the European Union and seven other countries that the duties - supposed to protect the US steel industry from cheap imports - were unfairly hurting their producers.

""This is not just a partial victory, this is a full victory. We have been given satisfaction on all accounts,"" said EU spokeswoman Arancha Gonzalez.

In a joint statement, the eight complainants called on the United States to remove the measures ""without delay."" The EU said it was ready to impose $2.2 billion in retaliatory duties on US imports.

US President George W Bush introduced the ""safeguard"" duties of up to 30 per cent on steel products in March of last year. Administration officials argued the tariffs were allowed under WTO provisions that allow temporary duties for up to three years to protect a domestic industry from a flood of cheap imports and give it time to restructure.

But the European Union and its allies complained that the move was in breach of a whole raft of WTO rules and threatened to raise their own import tariffs in response.

There was no immediate response from the United States to today''s ruling, but when the interim ruling was released in March, officials said they would appeal against the decision. That would allow the duties to stay in place for a while longer.
