On Wednesday, Sena shakhas swung into action, in close co-ordination with the BJP-VHP activists, to ensure complete bandh, from which essential services have been exempted. In a significant development, Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has exhorted all Muslims who are shocked by the Gandhinagar tragedy to join the all-India bandh. Commercial markets, private enterprises, industrial units and educational institutions will remain closed on Thursday, a VHP functionary said.

Sena chief Bal Thackeray had, in a press statement on Tuesday, criticised the Sangh Parivar for declaring a unilateral bandh. However, senior VHP functionaries and chief of the BJPâ€™s Mumbai unit, Vinod Tawde, on Wednesday held telephonic talks with Uddhav to clear the â€œmisunderstandingâ€� and finalise the nitty-gritty of the strike.

â€œThe bandh will be total and peaceful. The Sena will in no way encourage violence as we do not want to trivialise the tragedy. Again, the bandh is not directed against any religious community,â€� Uddhav told TNN on Wednesday.

A large number of commercial establishments, mercantile associations and educational institutions have extended support to the bandh, Tawde claimed.

1,Crises force govt to re-think tourism strategy,"BANGALORE: Karnataka will have to evolve a separate strategy to market its tourist destinations following a considerable drop in the tourist inflow due to disturbances, Tourism Minister D B Inamdar said here on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters Inamdar said not many tourist destinations have been affected yet there is an adverse impact on the tourism industry due to cancellation of buses and general advisory given to its citizens by many countries. ``It is difficult to quantify the losses but we will try to market the destinations as unaffected and lure the tourists,'''' he added.

He accused the Centre of discriminating against Karnataka with respect to Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ). In Kerala, the CRZ is 50 metres from the sea while in Karnataka it is 500 metres where all kinds of construction activity are prohibited.

Inamdar said eco-tourism, heritage site visits and adventure tourism, including rock-climbing and boat-rafting, will be encouraged.

4,Chautala lashes out at Ajit at Jind rally,"JIND: The record turnout at the Jind rally on Wednesday proved that the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) still has a strong grip on the rural masses.

Lashing out at Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh, chief minister Om Prakash Chautala said, â€œHe is a leader without any base.

He should come and see this gathering to know the definition of a rally.â€�

He announced a number of schemes on this occasion which included Chaudhary Devi Lal Rashtra Utthan Evam Parivar Kalyan Yojana (DEVIRUPAK) aimed atstabilising population and checking declining sex ratio and facility of free health check up and spectacles to all beneficiaries of old age pension scheme.

Refuting allegations that the function was organised at Jind to gain political mileage, Chautala said that even the Pandavas had offered worship at Jayanti temple in Jind before fighting the battle of Mahabharta for righteousness.

He denied the allegation that his government did not take interest in the completion of Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal when Parkash Singh Badal was ruling in Punjab.

He pointed out that when Congress was in power at the Centre, it was also ruling in Punjab and Haryana, but it did not do anything to construct and complete the SYL canal.

Had this canal been completed, the state would have got annual revenue of Rs 500 crore and the farmers would have been more prosperous.

He reminded that when Devi Lal was the chief minister of Haryana and Badal of Punjab, a sum of Rs one crore was given for the construction of SYL canal.

He said that it was Devi Lal who had first decided to give a compensation of Rs 400 per acre to those farmers whose crops would be damaged due to natural calamities, but his government had enhanced it to Rs 2,000 per acre.

He assured the farmers that they would get adequate water and power.

He pointed out that the state was not dependent on Ajit Singh who always tried to get political mileage out of everything.

President of Bharatiya Janata Party R Venkaiah Naidu paid rich tributes to Devi Lal and said that he had never witnessed such a massive crowd. He described Devi Lal as a great leader who stood for the cause of the poor.

Badal described him as an institution who had inspired the humanity. He said his birthday should be celebrated at the national level as â€œKisan Dayâ€�.

He urged Chautala to visit Delhi soon to impress upon the Central government to announce the minimum support price of paddy.

Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala presiding over a function held to commemorate Devi Lalâ€™s 89th birth anniversary at Jind, on Wednesday. Along with him are Union railways minister Nitish Kumar, BJP president Venkaiah Naidu and former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal.

5,Film stars support farmers on Cauvery issue,"BANGALORE: Actors got into the act on Wednesday and extended support to the ongoing farmers'' agitation on Cauvery through a `Cauvery nammadu'' (Cauvery is ours) march on the main roads of Bangalore.

A few days ago, farmers in Mandya had expressed ire that the film industry had not responded to the Cauvery agitation and stoned some theatres there.

Led by Rajkumar, a film industry delegation including Mandya MP and actor Ambarish, Anant Nag, MLCs Mukhyamantri Chandru and Umasri and others called on Governor T.N. Chaturvedi and Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to submit a memorandum expressing the film industry''s views on the issue.

``Both of them read the memorandum, but neither of them assured us of any action on it,'''' Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce president K.V. Chandrashekar said.

This is the second time in the last two years that the film industry has come to the streets on an issue. On September 21, 2000, a similar march was taken out to press for Rajkumar''s release from the clutches of Veerappan.

On Wednesday, people started gathering at the Maharani''s Arts College grounds from 9 am. The procession, which was supposed to take off at 10 am, started half an hour late and wound its way past Cauvery Bhavan, through K.G. Road, Hudson Circle and Kasturba Road to Gandhi Statue on M.G. Road.

6,Police chief appeals for calm during bandh,"MUMBAI: The BJP, the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have teamed up with the Shiv Sena to enforce a bandh today to condemn the terrorist attack on the Swaminarayan temple in Gandhinagar.

Chhagan Bhujbal, who is in charge of the home department, held a meeting of senior officials of the police, the BMC, the railways and the BEST to take stock of arrangements for the bandh.

7,Forcing bandh is contempt of court: lawyer,"MUMBAI: As you sit twiddling your thumbs at home, this thought is bound to cross your mind â€” Didnâ€™t the supreme court declare strikes and bandhs called by political parties as illegal and unconstitutional?

So, is the Shiv Sena committing contempt of court by bringing the city to a halt on Thursday? No, says senior advocate P.R. Vakil. â€œThe Senaâ€™s call for a bandh will invite contempt of court only if the party tries to force citizens to comply with the bandh.

If everyone voluntarily decides to participate in the bandh then no legal action can be initiated against the party,â€™â€™ he said. However, it is common knowledge that during every bandh, motorists who venture out have their windshields smashed, buses and trains are stoned and a fear psychosis stalks the city. As a result people remain at home.

In 1998, the SC had upheld a Kerala high court judgment banning general strikes or â€œbandhsâ€™â€™ organised by political parties and trade unions as â€œunconstitutional and illegalâ€™â€™. It directed the state government to take steps to recoup the loss caused by destruction of public and private properties from those groups calling the bandh.

â€œRight from the 1960s, the Indian judiciary has maintained that such bandhs are illegal. Now the question is:Why hasnâ€™t it been enforced? Is there a lack of will or any other compulsion on part the judiciary?â€™â€™ says lawyer Vibhabh Krishna.

He says the supreme court or anybody in the judicial hierarchy can take suo motu cognizance of forcible implementation of a bandh or a citizen can move the judiciary. Also, the courts can haul up the person or persons issuing such a call or the head of the organisation involved in it, he adds.

8,"SP, Congress ask BSP to postpone rally","LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party on Wednesday fervently appealed to the BSP to â€œpostponeâ€� its proposed rally in the state capital on September 28, in view of the terrorist attack on the Swaminarain temple in Gandhinagar.

â€œIt is not the right time to hold a massive rally like the one sponsored by the BSP,â€� the leader of opposition in the UP Vidhan Sabha, Mohamad Azam Khan said, while strongly pleading his case against the rally. He said that the BSP must reconsider its decision and desist from holding the rally at a time when the country is shocked by the terrorist attack on the temple.

â€œViolence,â€� he said, â€œhad no scope in a democracy and hence, it is the duty of the political parties to create an atmosphere conducive to peace and amity, particularly in the volatile situation created after the Gandhinagar incidentâ€�.

The two parties should reconsider their decision to hold the rally, the SP leader emphasised. Echoing similar views, senior Congress leader Jagadambika Pal said that Deputy PM LK Advani should not participate in the proposed rally. He further said that instead of wasting his time at the rally, he should visit the homes of those killed in the terrorist attack on the temple in Gandhinagar.

Besides being the Deputy PM, Advani represents the Gandhinagar parliamentary constituency and as such, he was duty-bound to share the grief and anguish of the affected families, Pal said, during an informal chat with reporters.

10,Jharkhand bandh turns violent in Dumka,"DUMKA: The district, which remained peaceful during the earlier bandhs over the domicile issue, witnessed incidents of violence during the Jharkhand bandh on Tuesday.

The bandh call was given by Salkhan Murmuâ€™s Jharkhand Disom Party and 58 other tribal organisations.

The bandh supporters, about 400 in number, came out on the streets and forced the shopkeepers to close their shops. They also damaged some shops at local Pokhra Chowk and Tin Bazar Chowk.

The bandh supporters blocked the Dumka-Pakur Road just in front of the Town police station. They demanded a meeting with Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi who was staying here at that time. The road blockade was removed when the district administration arranged them an appointment with the chief minister.

Marandi left the district headquarters after having a talk with the tribal youths but, perhaps, he was not aware that after his departure the bandh supporters will become hostile. Shouting slogans, like â€œBabulal Marandi zindabadâ€� and â€œDomicile policy lagoo karoâ€�, the tribal youths reached Tin Bazar chowk and harassed the petty shopkeepers. Later, the shopkeepers retaliated and AJSU Santhal Parganas division president Prem Chand Kisku received serious head injuries during the clash.

Other incident of violence occurred at Pokhra Chowk. Here too, the shopkeepers clashed with the bandh supporters. They forced the bandh supporters to leave the spot.

The district administration which was more concerned with the security of the chief minister came into action after the violent incident of Tin Bazar Chowk.

Heavy police force was deployed at the sensitive points of the town. However, the situation look a violent turn at Pokhra Chowk despite the â€˜heavy deployment of police force, including the SDO (sadar), Dumka.

The police have arrested 13 people and two FIRs have been lodged with the town police station in this connection. One FIR was been lodged by Prem Chand Kisku against unnamed people while the other FIR was lodged by a reporter of an electronic media against people who broke his camera and snatched his identity card.

Meanwhile, Maulik Adhikar Suraksha Manch, in a press release, has held the Jharkhand CM responsible for the whole incident. Nothing would have happened had Marandi not met with the tribal youths, it alleged. On the other hand, AJSU leader Prem Chand Kisku has complained that the administration arrested only the tribal youths while no one from the other group which indulged in the violence was arrested.

12,Police on full alert to face bandh call,"PATNA: The Bihar police have taken steps to mobilise additional forces to ensure peace during the bandh called by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Thursday to protest against the terrorist attack on Akshardhan Mandir in Gandhinagar.

â€œWe have directed zonal IGs and DIGs to mobilise additional forces so that the bandh passes off peacefully,â€� stated DGP R R Prasad, adding that the police have been asked to remain fully alert on Thursday.

13,568 Cong men in Saurashtra fill forms for polls,"RAJKOT: As many as 568 Congress men have shown their willingness to contest the ensuing state Assembly elections for the 58 seats from Saurashtra.

Congress leaders have termed this trend as ""a wave in their favour and the mood of the people to go in for a change"".

Gadhada in Bhavnagar district has the highest number contestants with as many as 36 people filling up the forms.

Saurashtra has been a Patel-dominated region, and out of the total 568 aspirants, almost 74 per cent are from the Patel community.

One of the reasons attributed for the high percentage of Patel leaders trying to enter the electoral arena was the fact that there were better chances of winning if one was a Patel candidate.

After the Patels, the highest number of forms were from the Koli community, which also has considerable number of voters, though mainly concentrated in the Bhavnagar and Amreli region.

However, the Congress in Saurashtra also fears that the rejection of forms may turn a large number of prospective candidates into passive workers, which could harm their interests at the hustings. The party also fears that some may even seek a ticket from the BJP in case they were denied by the Congress.

A senior Congress leader told TNN on Monday that ""some of these leaders would be asked to withdraw on the assurance of giving them a lucrative post once the party was elected to power"".

At present, the BJP has complete sway over the region. Out of the 58 seats, the saffron brigade has all but six seats under their belt.

""Bandhs only cause economic losses to the country. Even if a bandh has to be organised, it has to be on behalf of all organisations and not separately. Moreover, it should be symbolic for a few hours or half-a-day aimed at paying respects to the deceased,"" Sadhu Mukund Jiwan Das, head of the Swaminarayan temple in Delhi, said.

He was responding to a question on whether the sect supported the Bharat bandh call given by the Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Shiv Sena.

Recalling that industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani''s children did not allow work to suffer even after his death, Das said, ""the task of nation building must go on.""

Earlier, scores of Swaminarayan devotees alongwith activists of the All India Anti-Terrorist Front paid homage to the devotees and security personnel killed in the Akshardham temple attack by maintaining two minutes'' silence, singing devotional songs and chanting Swaminarayan mantra.

27,Five hurt in clash at Dayal Singh College,"NEW DELHI: Five persons were injured when a fight broke out between two rival student groups at Dayal Singh College on Thursday afternoon. One of injured, Inderjeet, received minor head injuries. They were all discharged after receiving medical aid.

While one of the group leaders, Anoop Basoya, joint secretary of Delhi University Students Union, claimed he was shot at, the police said no bullet injuries were found on him. â€˜â€˜Investigations are on and we are verifying his charge,â€™â€™ deputy commissioner of police (south) P Kamaraj said.

28,Police rule out local hand in attack,"AHMEDABAD: Officials pursuing investigations into the bloody storming of the Akshardham temple are almost ruling out the possibility of the two terrorists being Gujaratis, despite the letters found on their person proclaiming that they were out to avenge the killings during the riots.

Inspector general of police with the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) Vipul Vijoy is sure that the two youth must have received at least a couple of years'' training and could not be locals. The indications, according to him, are that they ""could be either from Kashmir or abroad"". ""We believe they could belong to either the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) or the Jaish-e-Mohamad (JeM) groups,"" he told mediapersons on Thursday.

The case is being investigated by the Gandhinagar district police with assistance from the ATS and other intelligence agencies. Chief Minister Narendra Modi has also announced that the case, lodged at the Sector 21 police station in Gandhinagar, would be investigated by a high-powered committee headed by the state DGP.

Police officials are sure that if they did not belong to Gujarat, the duo must have at least had local contacts who helped them get to Akshardham, conduct a reconnaissance mission, and dropped them near the target in a ""white car"".

Although there are no confirmed reports about the language spoken by the terrorists, some people testified that one of them asked for directions in Hindi, while some said they spoke in Gujarati. This was, however, refuted by Modi in his news conference!

According to the CM, the terrorists ""either belonged to PoK or to the neighbouring enemy nation"" and were highly motivated and trained.

On some saying there were five terrorists, Vijoy said, ""These are testimonies made in a moment of panic and will have to be verified.""

Commenting on the terrorists'' daredevilry, an additional director general of police said, ""Training can be given even in a short while, if there is enough motivation and drive"". According to him, ""The commitment and the readiness to die can come if you have seen your father, mother or family member being killed before your eyes.""

Some officers also believe that the pattern of killing employed by the terrorists made evident the fact that they lacked training. ""With the kind of ammunition and time they had, they could have killed many more while here most have died of the grenade attacks instead of bullets,"" observes a senior police officer.

Says former DGP MM Singh, ""If you are physically capable, it does not take more than a day to train in operating a weapon, even an automatic one.""

Modi, on his part, emphatically made it clear that they were not locals and neither did they speak Gujarati. Asked about the letters recovered from the terrorists claiming to avenge the post-Godhra riots, Modi quipped that the letters were ""deliberately kept to misguide investigators"".

According to Vijoy, some of clues, such as the brand labels on their clothes and shoes, were being followed up on to establish the terrorists'' identity. The government has announced a Rs 1 lakh reward for any clues leading to the identity of the terrorists or the organisation named in the letters - Tehreek-e-Kasas. The police officers, however, believe that the TeK could be a front for a major terrorist outfit like the JeM or the LeT.

29,"BJP councillors support bandh, abstain from work","VADODARA: The BJP may have distanced themselves from the VHP sponsored bandh, but the city mayor and BJP councillors were conspicuous by their absence at the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) office here on Thursday.

The Congress alleged that they were out on the streets helping the VHP ""under the pretext of field work"". City Mayor Bharati Vyas did not visit her office, as did most of the BJP members. The BJP members also planned to postpone the standing committee meeting after holding a short condolence meeting for those killed at Akshardham.

Congress municipal councillor Manoj Thakor told TNN that, while BJP had initially denied supporting the bandh, their municipal corporators were out on the street enforcing the bandh. According to him the BJP was playing safe. ""No doubt they support the bandh, but will associate with it only at the end of the day when they find that it was peaceful. If it turns violent they would discredit the VHP and thus causing no harm to their image,"" Thakor said.

""There were many BJP councillors who were asking people to down their shutters. But this time, unlike in the past when they carried their ''khes'' (saffron bands) across their shoulders to assert their identity, they did not come out in the open as BJP supporters,"" he added.

When contacted Mayor Bharati Vyas denied that she had taken leave from office. ""I was out on field work and therefore could not go to the VMC. My absence had nothing to do with the bandh call,"" she said. She also refused to comment on the nature of support that the BJP had given to the VHP bandh.

However, BJP councillor Rashesh Parikh said that they had supported the bandh call as it is given by ""our sister concern"". ""The bandh has been successful and it was completely voluntary,"" he said.

The opposition members however denied that the VHP bandh was voluntary. The city youth Congress president Kiran Raj said, ""They have enforced the bandh. We saw BJP councillors at Raopura, Wadi and Baranpura asking people to down their shutters. Moreover, at many places they used the state government machinery, including the police, to compel people to close shops."" According to him the police had towed the BJP line even on Wednesday. ""When we were requesting for a bandh on Wednesday through voluntary co-operation, the police arrested our people. But on Thursday the police themselves were involved in asking shop owners to down shutters. This happened in Gorwa,"" claimed Raj.

31,Stray violence mars bandh in Kerala,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The hartal called by VHP-Shiv Sena in Kerala on Thursday to protest the temple attack in Gujarat turned into a bandh, and normal life was disrupted.

Isolated incidents of violence arred the generally peaceful bandh.

Government offices functioned with skeleton staff as all vehicular traffic was off the roads. Shops, business establishments and hotels remained closed. But trains operated as usual. Educational institutions had declared a holiday. Police forces were deployed at railway stations, places of worship and major power installations to prevent trouble.

The VHP and Shiv Sena followers held separate protest marches in the city. The Sena marchers clashed with police near the power house road on the question of the route of the march. The police diverted the march to avoid a mosque in the vicinity, to which the Sena workers objected. In the verbal exchanges and a scuffle, a couple of marchers suffered injuries. However the march terminated without the situation escalating further.

In Muttathara area of the city, a CPM office was destroyed in fire. The Marxist leaders accused the VHP of being behind it.

32,Bandh absence to be treated as CL for govt staff,"BANGALORE: The Karnataka government employees absent on both ``bandh days'''' (September 12 and on Thursday) must apply for casual leave. If they have exhausted it, they stand to lose a day''s salary.

Official sources told The Times of India here on Thursday that the employees were required to reach the office ``on their own'''' as no assurance was given to them at the time of recruitment about providing transport facility.

``It is the primary responsibility of employees to come to office whatever be the situation,'''' they added.

However, the Karnataka State Government Employees Association (KSGEA) is planning to request the government to consider the mass absenteeism of employees as ``special casual leave'''' although there is no provision.

KSGEA president Sippe Gowda said till now, there is no word either from the chief secretary''s office or from DPAR. ``We will approach on our own to discuss the issue after the association takes a decision,'''' he added.

About 10-15 per cent of employees reached their work place as buses were cancelled on September 12 due to the Bangalore bandh.

According to sources, the provision of ``special casual leave'''' is applicable only if employees go on strike en masse and if it is justified. ``Treating mass absenteeism as special casual leave would tantamount to extending tacit support to the bandh. No government ever supports any bandh, even if it is called by the party ruling the state,'''' they maintained.

34,Special law against CSA sought,"PUNE: Over 100 activists belonging to 30 womenâ€™s organisations in the city on Wednesday demanded the enactment of a special law to prevent child sexual abuse (CSA) and also called for stringent action against the sale of illicit liquor in Pune district.

The demands were raised in two memoranda submitted to district collector Madhukar Kokate. Earlier, the activists took out a march from the Mazoor Adda near Faraskhana to the collectorate to highlight their demands. A delegation met the collector.

The memorandum submitted on behalf of the Stree Mukti Andolan Sampark Samiti expressed serious concern over the recent cases of rape and molestation reported in the city.

The Samiti said the incident of rape that took place on the University of Pune campus should be investigated thoroughly and it should be checked whether the culprit was really a policeman.

The activists have also demanded that the definition of rape be made more comprehensive and the onus of proof should be on the accused.

They also demanded that an attempt to rape be considered as serious as rape. Asking for a separate law to prevent child sexual abuse, the activists said that even in such cases, the onus of proof should be on the accused.

In another memorandum submitted on behalf of the Maharashtra Darumukti Andolan Samiti, its convenor Shubha Shamim drew the attention of the administration to the continuing sale of illicit liquor in Pune district.

â€œThe recent incident at the Sangawade village where at least six people died after consuming spurious liquor is an indication of how the sale is thriving in rural areas,â€� she remarked.

The committee has demanded strict implementation of the Prohibition Act by the police, administration and the state excise department.

Shamim demanded that a no-objection certificate from local residents be sought while granting new permits for a bar or liquor shop.
