Led by BJP national vice-president Madan Lal Khurana and Delhi unit president Mange Ram Garg, the protestors attempted to take out a march towards the Delhi Secretariat after staging the demonstration but were prevented by police.

1,Punjab farmers face health hazards,"BATHINDA: As evening descends, black clouds of smoke obscure the rural skyline in this part of Punjab. The farmers are burning wheat straw and chaff, much to the detriment of the local ecology. Agriculture in Punjab, which already faces numerous ecological and economical hazards due to excessive use of pesticides, insecticides and fertilizer, is now threatened by loss of fertility and destruction of eco-friendly worms due to the practice of burning crop residue every rabi and kharif season. The smoke from the burning of chaff also leads to eye and lung ailments. The worst sufferers are the asthama patients. Farm scientists have advised them to leave the fields fallow for about a month after harvesting the wheat crop, but the landstarved farmers are in a hurry to sow paddy. The crop residue consists of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and mineral materials which are good for the next crop. But, when the authorities concerned are least bothered to guide or deter the farmers from the wasteful practice, the farmer sees only his end of season profit and not ecological balances. The phenomenon of burning stubble has increased with the introduction of combine-harvesters which leave about a foot or two of stubble in the field. So, as farmers set the fields on fire in the evenings, the road along the fields come under a thick layer of smoke. The fires spread to the trees along the boundaries of the fields and thousands of them, belonging to forest department, perish every season. The pollution control board authorities term the practice illegal but nobody challenges the practice in a state whose livelihood is agriculture. And deputy commissioners and agriculture officers of the area give educated explanations of the disadvantages of burning biomass but hardly ever put that knowledge to good use.

5,Booth-capturing mars Bhiwandi polls,"THANE: The first-ever elections to the Bhiwandi-Nizampur municipal corporation on Sunday was marred by incidents of stone-pelting and booth-capturing.

Three incidents of bogus voting were reported and 65 people were arrested in various incidents of violence, according to the police.

Around 12.45 pm, a mob went on a rampage by throwing stones and soda water bottles in a bid to capture polling booths in the area.

This despite the heavy police bandobast and the deployment of rapid action force and SRP platoons.

According to offical estimates, the electorate turnout was around 45 per cent. The low turnout was because of the recent killing of Bajrang Dal activist advocate Lalit Jain which had created communal tension in the township.

6,FSJ condemns Gujarat riots,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a symposium on â€œGenocide in Gujarat: An Action for the Future which was jointly organised by the Forum for Social Justice (FSJ) and Movement for Empowerment of Muslim Indians (MOEMIN), called upon the people to bridge the psychological divide created between the Hindus and the Muslims by politicians.

Addressing the participants, president of Confederation of Voluntary Organisations (COVA) Mazher Hussain said that rehabilitation of riot victims should get precedence over all other work and should form a major component of the process of restoration of peace in Gujarat.

He deplored the manner in which the Gujarat government had handled the rehabilitation work.

Prof Anwar Moazzam, retired Professor of Islamic studies, Osmania University, said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) could succeed in creating a communal atmosphere in Gujarat only because of the support given by the the BJP government.

He said that Indiaâ€™s secularism was strong enough to fight fundamentalist organisations like the RSS.

Prof P L Vishweshwar Rao, convener of the Forum for Social Justice, said that the Gujarat riots have shown that fascism has grown in India by leaps and bounds.

He said that it posed a great danger to the secular fabric of this country.

â€œIf the Sangh parivar is not stopped in its tracks, it would â€˜Talibaniseâ€™ the country,â€� he said.

Former minister Basheeruddin Babukhan; social activist Prof Kancha Ilaiah; Paul Diwakar, convener of the National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights; and Prof Keshav Rao Jadav, president of AP Chapter of PUCL, also addressed the gathering.

8,‘Over 6 lakh workers affected in Gujarat riots’,"MUMBAI: More than 6.6 lakh workers have been affected by the riots in Ahmedabad alone, according to the Trade Union Solidarity Committee, Mumbai.

The committee had sent a team of activists to Gujarat in April, together with activists from other unions in the country, to assess the situation there.

According to the committeeâ€™s findings, those affected include workers in the informal sector like hawkers and rag pickers as well as factory workers.

Powerloom and diamond workers have been worst hit with over 300,000 of them affected by the riots. More than 11 lakh have been rendered homeless in the state.

The committee estimates that the daily loss in wages totals to more than Rs 45 crore a day in Ahmedabad alone.

Besides, 75 per cent of industries in the whole of Gujarat have been affected, it says.

The visiting team, which was able to gather some statistics on the loss and damages to properties, has described the damages as â€œmind-bogglingâ€™â€™ compared to those suffered during the 1969 riots in the state.

Twenty-nine districts are affected this time, as opposed to 11 in 1969, and there have been 837 reported deaths compared to 519 last time. The number of reported injuries have doubled.

The riots have damaged property worth Rs 681 crore compared to Rs 5 crore in 1969. The 1969 riots lasted for 11 days.

The team visited riot hit areas and relief camps of all communities. In a press statement, the team said that in many bastis, residents from both communities said that the attacks had come from outsiders and that they had been living peacefully. â€œThe destruction of property was well planned, â€˜â€™ the team stated.

The committee has called for unity among all unions in restoring harmony and peace and fighting communalism.

Condemning the burning of the train in Godhra and the subsequent violence in the state, the committee has demanded that the guilty be punished and immediate steps be taken to restore peace and security.

The committee has also demanded that a survey be carried out to assess the number of workers affected in the state, people in the relief camps be rehabilitated immediately and that widows and orphaned children be given special priority.

9,Home Trade pinch hurts co-ops badly,"MUMBAI: For the 650-plus cooperative banks in Maharashtra, this is the worst of times.

The multicrore securities scam, a shaken investor confidence and the ensuing media focus have overshadowed the banksâ€™ micro-finance network which have ushered in the best of times for the small and marginal borrowers.

The widespread temptation at the moment is to term the entire co-operative banking sector as unbankable.

It is being labelled as an institution of corruption, serving the interests of politicians and other directors on its board.

Aggreived by the accusations, Satish Marathe, the managing director of the Mumbai-based Jankalyan Sahakari Bank said: â€œThe co-operative sector began as a movement in Maharashtra and has not failed, but there are some cooperatives which have failed the movement.â€�

Almost 45 per cent of the lendings in the rural areas, for agriculture or industry, is done through the co-operative banks, thereby, near-eliminating the traditional money-lenders. It was this concept of co-operatives which inspired social empowerment and financial reforms for the needy sections in the state.

However, the grand vision of stalwarts like Padmashree Vithalrao Vikhe-Patil, Dr Dhananjay Gadgil and Vaikuntbhai Mehta now seem to be earning a bad name.

The entire sector has been faulted for the misdeeds of the 10-odd co-operative banks and a sleeping watchdog, auditors and officials of the Reserve Bank of India and the state co-operative department.

â€œIt is insulting and painful when you are measured in the same scale as the corrupt scam-tainted bankers,â€� complains Vishwas Thakur, founder-chairman of the Vishwas Co-operative Bank in Nashik. Despairing co-operative bankers seem unanimous in their opinion that stern action should be taken against all those guilty in the securities scam.

They are upset that the government has done little to sound reassuring to the public and squash the overall suspicion. Take the case of Thakurâ€™s bank.

Established in 1997, it is actively involved in funding self-help womenâ€™s group. â€œWe have a tie-up with the Nashik municipal corporation, which shells out 50 per cent of the total capital investment to these needy women.The other half of the credit is extended to them by our bank at a minimal interest rate,â€� said Thakur, who was awarded for being the youngest founderchairman of a co-operative bank.

The bankers wonder if an impression is being subtly created in favour of the commercial and private banks which have been lusting for a cash-rich rural base in Maharashtra.

10,Employees rally against retrenchment,"HISAR:The Haryana government is pushing us to a showdown, said R C Jagga, general secretary, Sarv Karamchari Sangh, Haryana, addressing a massive state-level rally of the employees here on Sunday.

He said about 12,000 employees had been retrenched, about 25,000 posts abolished and their trade union rights had been withdrawn.

Despite the mercury soaring above 46 degrees C, thousands of employees from all over the state arrived to raise their voice against the large-scale retrenchment of employees and privatisation of government departments, corporations and boards.There was a substantial representation of women employees as well.

''''This time resentment is at its peak and employees are ready to go on indefinite strike if the government continues with its policy of sacking employees. Many employees at their age cannot establish their own enterprises. In the minor irrigation and tubewells corporation (MITC) itself will 4000 employees be rendered jobless. This is unjust,'''' said Jagga.

President of the sangh, Poonam Chand Ratti said,''''The farmers have already requested the chief minister not be disband the MITC as they need it for irrigation.''''

He said that during the monsoon session of the assembly, the sangh would organize the ''Chandigarh March'' and submit a memorandum of 20,000 signatures.

The Sarv Karamchari Sangh has announced to hold dharnas in front of the houses of ministers, legislators and chairmen of different corporations and Boards on May 26 to demand the continuation of MITC.

Manjul Kumar Das, a leader from Bihar, was the key speaker in the rally.He said globalisation and liberalisation or privatisation were terms for economic imperialism and capitalism. They would ruin the future of India''s youth who desperately needed jobs. If any decision affects labourers or employees, the government should include representatives of these classes before implementing any new policy.

The rally unanimously resolved to press the government to accept the demands of the sangh, including regularisation of workcharge employees, part-time workers and ad hoc incumbents. The surplus staff should be adjusted against new posts.

12,Cong to go it alone in Goa polls,"NEW DELHI: Having failed in the seat sharing talks with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Congress on Monday announced the remaining four seats for the May 30 Goa Assembly polls.

In a bid to avoid division of ""secular"" votes, Congress had offered three seats to NCP and later even agreed to give four seats. However, NCP''s insistence for more seats led to breakdown of talks, Congress sources claimed.

13,BSP performs Krishna govt's `last rites',"BELLARY: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Monday performed the `last rites'' of the Karnataka government, which, it said, has failed to deliver the goods to the people of the state.

The ``mortal remains of the government'''' were taken out in a parade through the main streets of Bellary before performing the last rites at Royal Circle.

The rally was led by the leaders of Bellary district unit of the BSP -- D. Panduranga and B. Sivalinga, Mundaragi Nagaraj, Chellagurki Anjinappa, S. Vignesh, K. Mohan, Mahadev Arjun, Venkatesh, John Prakash, Jagadish, Tayappa, Erriswamy and others.

They submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Jawaid Akhtar, urging Governor V.S. Ramadevi to pressure the government to look into burning problems being faced by the common man.

They strongly condemned the state government''s move to increase power tariff, terming it ``anti-people'''' and ``anti-farmers''''. Citing the government''s decision to meter the electricity supplied under the Bhagya Jyothi scheme, the leaders said the government has no concern about the poor problems which have not spared those living below the poverty line.

They stated that the Congress government has failed to live up to the expectations of the farmers who returned the Congress to the office hoping their problems would be looked into. That very government is now ``burdening'''' the farmers'' lives by increasing the tariff on farmers'' pump sets, the leaders of BSP said.

They demanded the government to withdraw power tariff hike on pump sets as also the revised power tariff which would affect the common man and those living below poverty line. They said decision on fixing the meters to pumpsets under the Bhagyajyothi scheme be withdrawn. Also, the Veeresh Committee report should be rejected in toto.

14,"Sack Jayachandra, BJP tells govt","MANGALORE: BJP leader B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday urged Chief Minister S.M. Krishna to sack Agriculture Minister T.B. Jayachandra from the cabinet and initiate criminal proceedings against the task force for allowing the use of banned chemical `monocrotophos'' in containing coconut mite, and allegedly accepting kickbacks.

Speaking to reporters here, Yediyurappa said after the pesticide was used on 99 lakh of the 4.38 crore coconut trees in the state, 90 lakh had been destroyed.

He demanded compensation to the farmers and said the BJP leaders would tour the coconut-growing regions of the state soon and educate the farmers on the `fraud'' perpetrated on them.

Urging the chief minister to conduct a probe into the fraud, he said the BJP would cooperate and provide all the details needed to implicate the minister and the task force officials.

He maintained that the use of pesticide had drawn protests from Mandya farmers way back in 1998-99 and yet the agriculture minister recommended its use. He noted that the matter was also raised in the Legislative Council by Mysore MLC Madhusoodan a few months ago.

Giving details, he said Madhusoodan, along with Ravindra Shenoy, a scientist, had met Jayachandra to urge him against the use of pesticide but the minister exhibited ``lackadaisical attitude''''.

He said the minister in April had admitted that the pesticide was ``ineffective'''' and would destroy the crops. ``All this points to a deep-rooted corruption in which the minister is involved.''''

The government has spent Rs 11.14 crore on the programme of which Rs 7.1 crore was from the Centre.

Yediyurappa pointed out that Kerala government had banned monocrotophos and experts had confirmed it had deleterious effects on both coconut trees and humans, if consumed.

In the light of these, he urged the chief minister to sack the minister and arrest the task force officials for conniving with vested interests.

15,"Finances fine, retorts state govt","BANGALORE: The state government on Monday stated that its financial position is `satisfactory'' and that financial management receives the highest priority.

Refuting BJP MLA A. Ramdas allegations that Karnataka was bankrupt, the finance department furnished figures to The Times of India backing its contention. ``The state has emphasised on capital formation and never compromised on priority sector expenditure. It is one of the few states that has consistently achieved the projected plan size, which has been acknowledged by the Planning Commission. For instance, it has exceeded the contemplated expenditure of ninth plan by expending 110 per cent of the original amount,'''' Finance Secretary (Budget) R. Ramaseshan said.

Some positives included mobilisation of resources wherein the ratio of state taxes to GSDP increased from 8.05 per cent in 99-2000 to 8.6 per cent in 2000-01 and was expected to grow to 8..94 per cent in 2001-02. Besides, it had prepared the Medium Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) to balance revenue and stabilise debt stock. It was carried forward to high priority sectors like roads, water supply, education, health and maintenance expenditures of irrigation and buildings.

Ramaseshan said increasing revenue deficit was a matter of concern, but Karnataka has recognised the pitfall and the MTFP envisages elimination of revenue deficit by 2005-06.

As a percentage of GSDP, public debt has increased from 21 per cent in 98-99 to 24 per cent in 99-00 and is projected to increase to 32 per cent by 03-04 and fall to 30 per cent by 05-06. Though high, the state has fully provided for repayment. Also, with revenue deficit projected to be eliminated, additional resources would be available for capital expenditure, he said.

Ramaseshan said since dividend and interest from PSUs had been dwindling, the government had formulated a policy for restructuring. Five had been closed down and 2,100 employees had taken VRS, he stated.

There was shortfall of Rs 1,375 crore last year due to reduction of Rs 550 crore central taxes, Rs 735 crore state taxes, and Rs 90 crore non-taxes. It was balanced Rs 1,000 crore cut in revenue expenditure. However, the state did not resort to indiscriminate borrowing to meet the shortfall, he added.

16,Octroi collection reflects intensity of violence,"AHMEDABAD/VADODARA/SURAT: These are three different cities which have been affected in different ways by the ongoing riots that is continuing for the last 11 weeks. And the impact of the violence has started telling in varied ways on the tax collections in the respective cities.

While the state government continues to undermine the impact of the riots on the economy of the state, octroi collection in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat speak of how the violence has really affected business in the three cities.

On octroi collection, the main source of income for AMC, also registered a downfall. The average combined collection at 66 octroi outposts by AMC has fallen from Rs 90 lakh per day to Rs 62 lakh. ""The riots have directly affected our daily collections. Curfew in certain areas also acts as a dampener for transporters to venture inside the city,"" says T G Jhalawadia, deputy municipal commissioner (octroi).

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), that was cruising towards its target of octroi collection, saw a downturn in March, upsetting its figures. That the going was fine is evident in the octroi collection figures of January and February, that stood at Rs 8.89 crore and Rs 8.24 crore, respectively. And then February 27 happened and collection in March nose-dived to Rs 5.94 crore, almost Rs 5 crore lower than the target for the month. Officers say that but for the riots, VMC could have sailed past the target for the year 2001-2002, pegged at Rs 111 crore. The collection for the year has been just Rs 104.6 crore.

""We collected octroi of around Rs 8 crore in just 27 days in February, while in March the figures became dismal. It''s a huge loss. We were expecting to collect about Rs 10 crore to 10.50 crore in March, but due to the riots and the overall disturbance we could reach nowhere near this target,"" VMC deputy municipal commissioner Jayantkumar Sevak told TNN.

In Surat, the communal turbulence in the city in the initial days after the Godhra carnage on February 27 did slow down the economic activities but not for long as the police took effective action in controlling the violence, unlike Vadodara and Ahmedabad. The octroi collection by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) was around Rs 19.03 crore in March, around Rs 3 crore less than the monthly average. In April, the amount collected as octroi was Rs 22.59 crore.

According to deputy commissioner (special) Ashwin Mehta, the effect on the economic activities in the city in the month of March was marginal and from April onwards, it has regained its normal pace.

However, the octroi figure for the month of January being just Rs 16.71 crore, was lowest in the recent past. The reason being the month-long strike by the powerloom industry over the issue of power tariff, Mehta informed. The situation improved slightly with the strike by the powerloom industry called off from February. The total octroi collection in February was Rs 19.73 crore.

18,PF investments by state units under review,"MUMBAI: A high-level meeting, to be headed by the Maharashtra chief secretary V Ranganathan, on Tuesday will consider a proposal to scrutinise provident fund (PF) investments made by various state-owned undertakings. This is to find out whether any of the state corporations or federations, which manage employeesâ€™ provident funds, has conducted any transaction through the tainted brokers involved in the Rs 100-crore Seamen Provident Fund scam.

A top government official said a thorough scrutiny of various state-owned undertakingsâ€™ PF investments will be one of the proposals to be taken up in the meeting.

Sources said top bureaucrats have already started internally verifying these investments in few state-owned units, though no such dubious transactions have so far been reported.

Though most of these undertakingsâ€™ PF corpus is managed by the Central PF Commissioner there are quite a few PFs that are managed by independent trusts. It is permissible to manage this corpus by adhering to strict regulations drawn out by the Reserve Bank of India. This include up to 25 per cent in government securities, 40 per cent in public sector bonds, 15 per cent in government securities and the remaining in any of the above instruments as per the discretion of the board of trustees. Moreover, there is a mandatory inspection done by the PF inspector to ensure that investments adhere to these norms.

â€˜â€˜Mostly these fully state-owned units manage their investments in PF corpus through primary dealers, especially of those floated by public sector banks and very few transactions are done involving brokers. Since the returns generated from Central PF Commissioner are less than market-related returns, several agencies exercise the option to manage their PF monies to generate higher returns,â€™â€™ said a bond dealer.

In the recently-unearthed Seamen Provident Fund scam, the transfer of Rs 92 crore worth securities are still to be delivered which pertains to transactions that took place during the early 1998 and 1999. CBI has registered a case and the role of brokers namely, Gilt Edge, Home Trade and Euro Asian securities are being probed.
