2,Not an iota of development here,"HUBLI: Itâ€™s big size has been a curse for Ward 36 in the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation limits.

Financial disputes between the corporation, the Hubli-Dharwad Urban Development Authority and Karnataka Industrial Development Board has resulted in the corporation losing control over some areas and denying residents basic facilities.

The ward is home to a population which has bought plots and constructed houses in extension areas along Gokul Road. Their â€˜sweet homeâ€™ dreams have soured, with the HDMC failing to attend to the terrible roads and choking drains. The area belongs to the HDUDA.

The ward is divided into Mayur Nagar, Shakthi Nagar, Surabhi Nagar, Manjunath Nagar, Arun Colony, Chethana Colony, Moraji Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Krishan Colony, Venkateshwara Colony and Nanda Gokul areas. Gokul and Tarihal villages also fall within this ward. Lack of water for both residents and cattle in Tarihal and Gokul villages has been a major cause of concern.

The village, though included into the corporation limits decades ago, are yet to get water connections. Residents are at the mercy of unreliable borewells for their daily needs. The HDMC has already awarded tenders for construction of water tanks and digging of borewells in the two villages. But no contractor is willing to take up works as the HDMC is yet to pay up pending dues for works undertaken by them. The industrial areas are not developed, and even the roads not asphalted.

Shanthi Nagar and Tarihal Industrial Area come under the HDUDA and KIDB. Residents are disappointed with corporator Ramappa Krishnappa Badiger. Initially, they had pinned their hopes on Badiger, who is currently the chairman of the works committee in the corporation, but are feeling let down. Other than six borewells being drilled, no other work has been taken up for two years now. Badiger, is himself disappointed with his performance, and blames the HDMC, for contractors who have not been paid their dues.

3,BSNL staff protest against privatisation,"LUCKNOW: About 3000 BSNL employees from all over the country here to participate in the second All India Conference of BSNL Employees Union on Wednesday took part in a rally that started from DAV college and ended at the Vidhan Sabha to protest against the privatisation of the largest PSU with 3.5 lakh employees and shouted slogans against the blinkered policy of globalisation, anti-union activities and communalism.

Ahmad Hasan, leader of the opposition in the Vidhan Parishad, addressing the meeting said that telecommunications used to be considered the backbone of the nation and a number of Centreâ€™s departments were run on the revenue collected from BSNL. He also praised the information revolution in the country after the introduction of the BSNLâ€™s mobile services, especially due to competitive and cheap tariff rates.

He said that he was pleased that the BSNLEU was vociferously protesting against the privatisation of such an important PSU and wished them success in their endeavour. â€œThe Samajwadi Party has always taken the stand that profit- making organisations must not be privatised as this will be a regressive economic step,â€� he said.

4,Power theft increases after brief drop,"KOLKATA: The state governmentâ€™s inability to set up a special police force to nab power thieves and courts to try them is costing power utility CESC dear. The CESC has recorded an increase in power theft this year after recording a sharp decline in 2002. â€œWhen we started the campaign again st power theft in the middle of last year, it had a remarkable effect. In six to seven months, loss due to theft went down from 11 to 10 per cent. That translates to earnings for an additional 60 million units or Rs 14.4 crore,â€� said CESC executive director Santanu Chatterjee.

The decline in power theft raised hopes that the Indian Electricity (West Bengal Amendment) Act 2001 was acting as a deterrent. The West Bengal State Electricity Board, too, felt power theft had been arrested. â€œAll in all, it was a positive picture,â€� Chatterjee said.

But the optimism evaporated soon. Though theft detection continues to increase, officials in CESCâ€™s loss control cell said power theft is showing an increase again. â€œThe inordinate delay in action against offenders blunted threats of stiff jail terms and monetary penalties that had acted as a deterrent,â€� Chatterjee said. While the absence of a special police force to track and tackle power crimes hampered the companyâ€™s drive against offenders, what has been more damaging is the absence of fast track courts to try and dispose the cases quickly.

Hence, only an insignificant number of the several thousands power theft cases detected have reached the trial stage. Though power theft had been deemed a non-bailable offence, bails were granted after a weekâ€™s investigation. In 2001-02, of 11,603 cases in which meters were disconnected and 46,719 cases in which hooking was removed, only 294 arrests were made. In 2002-03, arrests increased to 859 with 12,418 meters disconnected and 58,139 hookings removed. In these two years, only 90 cases have reached the court and only five moved to the trial stage.

â€œThe Act calls for setting up a special police force and court. Unless these are done, it is difficult to check this crime that has been steadily corroding power utilities, including WBSEB,â€� Chatterjee said.

Power minister Mrinal Banerjee, while acknowledging the need for both, ruled out a separate police force due to financial constraints. He, however, said the state was keen to set up a special court to try power theft cases. â€œThe court should be set up this year,â€� he said.

5,UT notifies bylaws for property tax,"CHANDIGARH: The UT administration on Wednesday notified the byelaws for imposition of 5 per cent property tax by the Municipal Corporation within the municipal limits.

The draft notification for the tax was issued a month ago and the administration had given 15 daysâ€™ time for inviting objections. However, no objections were received within the stipulated time.

The administration had in May renotified 5 per cent property tax on the rateable value of commercial, industrial, institutional lands and buildings within the municipal limits, replacing the earlier notification for ten per cent tax issued in 1998.

With the notification, the administration has rejected the MC Houseâ€™s recommendation for levying two per cent property tax.

While war widows, war heroes, freedom fighters and those who laid down their lives for the country have been exempted from the payment of the tax, all other concessions proposed by the House for industrial lands, handicapped people and small time traders doing business from residential houses and colonies have been rejected by the administration.

The administration has also allowed levying of service charges on government buildings which would be 75 per cent of the tax calculated on them.

The tax in the first instance will be assessed between the date of publication of the self assessment scheme (SAS) and March 31.

Municipal Corporation sources said going by the notification the corporation could hope to generate a revenue of over Rs 15 crore annually as compared to the less than Rs 7 crore it was expecting to collect with two per cent property tax.

As per the scheme, the city has been divided into five groups - I, II, III, IV and V - by sectors. Each sector is divided into five zones - A, B , C, D and E. The properties that can be expected to fetch the highest rent in the sector have been classified under zone A.

A ten per cent rebate will be allowed if the assessee deposits the tax for the full year in time and 5 per cent of it is deposited for the half year in two instalments in time. The minimum tax will be Rs 50 per month.

7,Desperate govt turns to cloud seeding,"HYDERABAD: Faced with an unprecedented water scarcity and failure of monsoon, the government will opt for cloud seeding to get artificial rains.

Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday held a meeting with the officials of meteorological department, National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Tata Institute of Meteorology and experts from Pune to find out the possible reasons for the absence of pre-monsoon showers and continuation of heatwave in the state.

Naidu asked the experts from NRSA and director, meteorological department, Hyderabad, C V V Bhadram to work out the cost involved in the cloud seeding process. Naidu reportedly told the officials that the government would go for it on an experimental basis and asked them come out with a report shortly, official sources told The Times Of India.

The Tamil Naidu government had conducted cloud seeding experiments in the past but the exercise did not yield the desired results. The Andhra Pradesh government had also experimented with the process of inducing artificial rains but the effort failed miserably couple of years ago.

Recently, the Karnataka government had decided to go for cloud seeding to bring artificial rains. The Karnataka is reportedly spending about Rs seven crore for the operation.

""The company issued 22,400 individual policies (3,700 policies in FY-02) and 220 group policies in the period under review,"" SBI Life Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer R Krishnamurthy told reporters here on Thursday.

The total sum assured by the company has crossed Rs 4,000 crore while the total number of lives covered have exceeded five lakh, he said.

In the group life business, SBI Life has emerged a leader with a 30 per cent market share of the aggregate premium income of Rs 35 crore that the private sector players generated, he claimed.

12,"Pak govt talks with MMA, no move to sack NWFP govt","ISLAMABAD: After initial threats against the Islamist government in North West Frontier Province for adopting the Shariat law, Pakistan government held talks with leaders of the Mutahida Majlis e-Amal, but the defiant hardliners teamed up with mainstream opposition parties to oppose presentation of the maiden budget in Parliament.

Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali has confined the much-touted ""administrative"" action against NWFP to recalling its Chief Secretary and IGP on Wednesday, while assuring that there is no plan to dismiss the MMA government.

Following the recalls, MMA''s parliamentary leader Hafiz Hussein Ahmed today warned that ""what the government is doing in NWFP, its reaction will now be felt in the centre.""

Even as the Taliban-style Shariat bill, which prescribes a strict code of Islamic practices for the Muslim majority, was challenged in the Supreme Court by a private individual, officials and politicians close to Musharraf held talks with MMA leaders.

MMA, along with mainstream political parties, demanded Musharraf to quit as Chief of Army by August 14 this year to enable them to accept his Presidency. After intense negotiations, the MMA has agreed to extend its deadline for him to quit as Army Chief for a year but not beyond. Musharraf wants to stay at least for two more years.

Even as it held talks with Musharraf''s representatives, MMA teamed up with mainstream opposition parties Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-N, headed by exiled former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif respectively, for a joint strategy to prevent the Jamali government from submitting its first national budget in Parliament on June 7.

The Parliament remained shut down for the past six months due to opposition agitation against Musharraf and the government nervously announced dates to move its maiden budget. The opposition said it would not allow the government to get the budget approved by Parliament.

Meanwhile, Dr Aslam Khaki, a private citizen, filed a constitutional petition in the Supreme Court here asking it to restrain the NWFP assembly from implementing the Shariat law it was not competent to enact any law which was in violation of the Constitution.

Khaki contended that Islamisation or enforcement of Shariat were matters covered by Federal Legislative List.

He said that Islamisation of the laws was within the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Shariat Court and there was no provision in the Constitution for the establishment of any parallel court or institution for the same purpose or any Provincial Shariat Court.

The petitioner also questioned the educational qualification of MMA legislators through another constitutional petition. He said the MMA leaders did not possess requisite bachelor qualification to enact laws on Islam.

He s aid that NWFP ruling party members were neither educated nor developed enough to understand Islam and the contemporary issues of the modern world and have narrow view of the religion. ""They belong to a particular school of thought and sect as they are trained in orthodox and outdated system of Madrassas,"" he said.

13,"Off form, Naidu takes to pinch hitting","NEW DELHI: The day after, all was asunder in the BJP. The man in the eye of the biggest controversy since Tehelka, party president Venkaiah Naidu, lost his customary smile and his shirt, and it was left to lesser leaders to pick up the pieces.

The June Delhi afternoon only seemed to compound the heat that Naidu has been feeling ever since he talked about the party projecting Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy L K Advani as twin mascots in the next elections.

Vajpayee, who stunned everyone with a characteristically open-ended and subtle public rebuke on Wednesday night, called up Naidu on Thursday morning.

BJP leaders tried to put speculation that Naidu had been soundly scolded at rest. They said the PM had merely conveyed to the younger man that all the media reports should not affect the partyâ€™s self-confidence, but they were hard pressed to explain the PMâ€™s motive in first making such a statement on Wednesday and then assuring Naidu a day later.

Vajpayee had wrapped up his speech on Wednesday evening saying the party was ""full of self-confidence. Neither tired nor retired and Advani will lead it to victory.""

Naidu already had to sit through a session with the PM late on Wednesday night after the felicitation programme that came unstuck after Vajpayeeâ€™s speech. Advani was also present at that meeting.

The party is trying its best to deflect all attention from talk of a power struggle within. On Thursday morning it was decided at an emergency meeting of office-bearers not to react to the whole hype around the incident. It was when a clearly rattled Naidu was leaving after the meeting that he lost his temper on reporters who asked him whether he had been pulled up by Vajpayee.

""Your question is not justified, I will not answer,"" he said, adding to more persistent questioning: ""Is this an inquisition, do we have to consult the press regarding whom we talk to and what we talk? Is this relevant? I donâ€™t understand. Will the countryâ€™s agenda be decided by political parties or by you people? Do we have to spell out to you people to whom we talked and for how long?

When another reporter asked again why the PM was angry, he blew up: ""Yes, he (Vajpayee) must have spoken to you. This is a useless question. Who told you about it. Are you asking this on behalf of some political party.""

Naidu then insisted the prime minister had not said anything to him and accused the media of making absurd political insinuations.""

Anger apart, the beleaguered party president had to spend another day making the same round of explanations: That the issue was very clear; that the BJP had decided that the next parliamentary polls would be fought under Vajpayeeâ€™s leadership under whom everybody else, including Advani, came.""

Other leaders offering the same explanation to the plethora of queries that came raining in, painstakingly explained that ""Advani being in charge of the nitty gritty of the partyâ€™s election campaign is nothing new, it happens everytime.""

Then why did the PM mention it at all? This one had them stumped, though towards the latter half of the day explanations offered included: ""He is a poet PM. He is wont to say things poetically."" Or, ""He has done this before. Like when he told an NDA meeting that they were free to elect another leader.""

The drama unfolded on different stages. At a cabinet meeting in the morning, Human Resource Development minister and the number three in the BJP, Murli Manohar Joshi, congratulated the PM on his successful tour abroad and hoped Vajpayee would continue to lead the nation.

Sitting on the sidelines and watching are the NDA allies and Opposition parties, particularly the Congress. Reactions from the allies have ranged from the cagey Telugu Desam Party saying it was up to the BJP who they chose as leader, to the more impetuous Trinamool Congress making clear only Vajpayee can lead the NDA.

The congress has gleefully seized on the opportunity, describing it as ""yet another act in the ongoing soap opera"" and said ""it does not portray a very good picture of India internationally when the Chief Executive of the country is not taken seriously by his own party"".

Refusing to comment as yet on whether it sees a serious power struggle in its main rival, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said â€“ tongue firmly in cheek â€“ that his party would have to wait first for the next set of retractions from Naidu or Vajpayee or both.

14,Sex selection law tightened,"MUMBAI: For all those anxious couples, there will be no more male children for the asking. A recent amendment to the law governing pre-natal diagnostic techniques has banned tests to select the sex of test-tube embryos to be implanted in the womb.

The Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act 1994 has been renamed the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act 2003.

While the old act clamped down on sex determination tests during pregnancy, the new one tightens the screws on sex selection at the pre-conception stage and puts in place a string of checks and balance to ensure that the act is effective.

The new act specifies that every user of ultrasound sonographic equipment must register the machines and file monthly reports on the number and kind of procedures conducted. The reports are to be filed with the appropriate authority. In the case of Mumbai, this would be the local ward health officer.

Pre-natal diagnostics are supposed to be primarily used to aid infertility treatments. The little-known pre-implantation genetic diagnostic technique is used to detect genetic disorders and chromosomal deficiencies in three-day-old embryos. However, the process also reveals the sex of the embryo.

The fear is that the technique will be used to reject female embryos. Infertility specialists and implementing authorities have expressed doubts about the new lawâ€™s effectiveness. Some fear its misuse, while others are unsure about the logistics of enforcing it.

Experts emphasise that giving details of sonography tests amounts to breaching patientsâ€™ confidentiality. Said infertility expert Aniruddha Malpani, ""Potentially, the information on record can fall into the wrong hands and be misused to harass our patients.""

While the US is trying to pass a law to protect the privacy of patients, he added, ""here, weâ€™re doing the opposite"". Ward health officers agree that verifying the records will be an onerous task.

""We can only ensure compliance, but finding out whether they are lying will call for a separate monitoring apparatus,"" said one officer.

Most medical professionals complained about the ""needless paperwork"" the amendment entails. They also are alarmed about another provision that enables the authorities to summon anybody who may have information about any malpractice as defined under the act, search premises on suspicion and seize incriminating evidence.

But infertility expert Indira Hinduja welcomed the amendment. ""It wonâ€™t matter to the discerning practitioners anyway,"" she said. However, she sounds caution at the powers put in the hands of the officials ""which will trigger corruption"".

A health official at Mantralaya emphasised, ""The idea behind the amendment is to spread awareness and instil a fear of god in truant doctors.""

15,Angry residents protest against water shortage,"NEW DELHI: Over 500 residents of the south Delhi areas of Sadiq Agar and Greater Kailash took to the streets on Thursday morning to protest against severe water shortage. They gathered on the Josip Briz Tito Marg, disrupting traffic for over one hour.

Residents said that for several days they were not getting any water since the water supply to their area had been diverted to other areas. â€˜â€˜The situation has become unbearable. We just want to draw the authoritiesâ€™ attention to our plight,â€™â€™ said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Sadiq Nagar.

â€˜â€˜The protesters did not indulge in any violence and we managed to take them off the road within an hour,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (south) Vivek Gogia.

Delhi Jal Board (DJB) chief P K Tripathi denied that the areaâ€™s water was being diverted and said that the problem arose because of some civic agencies. â€˜â€˜DJB and PWD labourers broke a power cable while they were digging in the area. Hence, no water could be pumped from the Greater Kailash reservoir from 2 am on Thursday,â€™â€™ he said.

As a result, Saket, GK-I, East of Kailash, parts of Malviya Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Madangir and Dakshin Puri did not get any water on Thursday morning. While Tripathi said the power cable had been replaced and pumping started at 3 pm, it would take about a day for the situation to get back to normal. â€˜â€˜Things will improve by Friday afternoon,â€™â€™ he said.

The water situation in other parts of the city was no different. Amit Agarwal of Sector-A, Vasant Kunj, said the area gets water for only 15 minutes in the morning.

Archana Mishra who lives in NDMCâ€™s working womenâ€™s hostel on Bhagwan Das Road said for the past five days there was no water in the hostel.

People in Shakarpur in east Delhi damaged vehicles on Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon to protest against the water shortage.

Laxmi Nagar and Shakarpur areas were without power for over five hours on Tuesday night.

â€˜â€˜We have stepped up security around power and water utility offices in sensitive areas,â€™â€™ Gogia said.

16,Veerashaivas threaten Gulbarga bandh on June 11,"GULBARGA: The Gulbarga Zilla Veerashiva Samaj has given a call to observe Gulbarga bandh on June 11.

It is to protest against the alleged police excesses in Nimbarga village in Aland taluk and to demand an inquiry by the Corps of Detectives into the caste-clashes in Nimbarga village last week.

At a press meet on Wednesday, office-bearers of the samaj demanded the government to order an inquiry into the caste-clashes at Nimbarga village, to find the accused in the molestation case of a woman at Nimbarga. They demanded the release of 23 persons of the village arrested under the Atrocities Act and to suspend Gulbarga district additional SP for failing to check violent incidents in the village.

Sunanda Natikar, the victim of the molestation incident said four persons of the Dalit community entered her house on May 29 when there were nobody in the house and attempted to rape her. When they went to the police station, some Dalit youths abused them, hence leading to the clash.

But, the police police arrested people of only one community, some as young as 14 years and even some old people. He alleged that the Gulbarga district additional superintendent of police has created terror in the village and threatened that atrocity cases would be booked against all the villagers except Dalit community if they failed to co-operate.

This was the reason for the continuing tension in the village. Basava Reddy Itagi, president of Gulbarga Zilla Veerashiva Samaaj said he will speak to Mallikarjun Kharge and will demand to set-right the things immediately. If he fails to do so, Gulbarga bandh will be observed on June 11.
