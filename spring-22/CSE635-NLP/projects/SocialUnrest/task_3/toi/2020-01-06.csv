0,BJP rebel Ganga Bakht returns to party,"LUCKNOW: The three-month-old rebellion within the BJP almost ended on Sunday when rebel leader Ganga Bhakt Singh returned to the party fold and BJPLP leader Lalji Tandon hinting for a short cabinet expansion to induct a few dissidents into Mayawati ministry.

At a joint press conference addressed by Tandon and Singh at latter''s residence on Sunday, Singh said,''''They don''t have any complaints now as majority of their grievances have been redressed."" Singh, convenor of the BJP Bachao Samiti, who raised a banner of revolt against Tandon said that party has taken initiative for the redressal of their grievances. ""The party has agreed to end persecution and give due respect and respresentation to senior leaders in the organisation and ministry. We would now work together to take the party to a new height,"" he said and announced disbanment of the Samiti. Later he went to Mayawati''s residence with Tandon and had lunch with her.""Samiti was formed to save the party from going into disintegration. Since we have returned to our parent party there is no need for a separate organisation now,"" he added. Two BJP MLCs Ajit Singh and Avadh Pal Singh Yadav, who had also joined the rebels'' bandwagon, are also expected to return to the party.

Seven out of ten rebels, who are facing disqualification petition have so far returned to the party fold. Dissident MLAs Ravindra Pundir, Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh and Kovid Kumar Singh, however, continue to stick to their guns. They have announced to take their battle to its logical conclusion during the budgest session of the state Legislature.

""The government will fall. We would not open our cards now. Wait till the budgest session,"" claimed Ramashish Rai, the Samiti spokesperson and rebel BJP MLC.

The rebels seems to be chalking out a strategy to pull down the government during vote on account with the help of the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and other like-minded parties.

Aware of the opposition''s plan, the BJP had stepped up its efforts to force rebels close their ranks. Using carrot and stick, few rebels were sanctioned huge funds for carrying out development activities and others were offered cabinet berth.

Those who did not fall in line have been warned of losing their membership.

Comment: Such recurring dramas fool no one into believing that they are based not on opportunism but on ideology. As such, they are of little interest but to most dedicated of political junkies.

2,FII investment says Radio Mirchi is hot,"MUMBAI: In an acknowledgement of the leadership status of Radio Mirchi, Double Honours Holdings, a Mauritius based FII has invested $ 6 million for a 10 per cent stake in Entertainment Network (India).

The balance is held by the Times Group subsidiary Times Infotainment Media.

Double Honours is wholly-owned by the Canadian pension fund major CDP Capital. NM Rothschild & Sons (India) was the advisor to ENIL for the private placement of shares.

ENIL, which owns 10 FM licences, is at present acknowledged as the leader among the private FM radio companies, both in terms of listenership and revenues. At present, Radio Mirchi is on-air at Mumbai, Indore, Ahmedabad and Pune, and will soon launch in other cities, including Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.

This investment, which has come at a time when the entire media and entertainment industry is reeling under the effects of global recession post 9/11, will be a shot in the arm for the fledgling private FM radio industry, especially Radio Mirchi.

The investment implies that ENIL has been valued at $ 60 million (Rs 300 crore), a creditable achievement within one year of commencing operations. This is arguably a path breaking investment in the media sector after the last equity boom in media stocks.

Commenting on the development, AP Parigi, managing director of ENIL, said, â€œThis means that FIIs repose trust in Radio Mirchi. Hopefully this will set the trend for future investments in the FM radio sector by both FIIs and Indian investors. In spite of the hurdles of a skewed licence fee structure, a slow ad market and a repressive music royalty re-gime, the private FM radio companies have rekindled listeners interest in radio. If this sector is to attract investment, the government needs to address the issues of the licence fee structure and music royalty soon.â€�

The FM radio privatisation process has hit several roadblocks during rollout. Prominent among them are the licence fee structure, the litigation by successful bidders who withdrew after speculative bids and the delayed launch of metro services due to the stipulation of a common transmission tower. This investment at the beginning of the New Year may herald a new dawn for the FM radio industry. Meanwhile, the people at Radio Mirchi are singing: If itâ€™s on Radio Mirchi, its Hot!

3,YSR's plea for a govt house ignored,"HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy has been reportedly refused government accommodation although he enjoys cabinet rank by virtue of being the leader of opposition.

Rajasekhara Reddy had been seeking government accommodation for the last one year. Recently, his secretary wrote to the government seeking allotment of a minister''s quarters in Banjara Hills, but it is learnt that the request was turned down on grounds that the Banjara Hills quarters were specially designed for ministers to hold tele and video conferences. After a few reminders, the government is said to have offered a building at LakdikaPul but before the CLP leader could take a decision, it was allocated to the police department for housing the Saifabad police station.

According to sources, Rajasekhara Reddy is planning to sell his present residence at Road No 3 in Banjara Hills as a large number of commercial establishments have come up on the road. The sources said the government had in the past unsuccessfully fought a court case against Reddy on the house site, and he was even denied permission to sell the property.

Rajasekhara Reddy purchased the land in 1984 and built a house on two years later. The government in 1997 filed a case of land grabbing against him, but subsequently lost in 1999, when Reddy moved the High Court. The Congress leader''s application to sell the property is pending with the government.

""The CLP leader intends to shift to a government accommodation, until he builds another house, but the government is neither permitting him to sell the property nor providing accommodation in a government bungalow,"" the sources said.

Reddy''s aides pointed out that several government bungalows were allotted to IAS officers'' associations, and other individuals who are below the rank of minister.

4,NDA govt overlooked youth problems: Surjewala,"CHANDIGARH: All India Youth Congress president Randeep Surjewala urged its Punjab unit to bring at least 15,000 workers to participate in the proposed rally on January 12 at New Delhi.

The rally will highlight the failure of the NDA government on all fronts especially in solving youth problems.

Addressing the Punjab Youth Congress office bearers here on Saturday in presence of Punjab Congress chief H S Hanspal, Surjewala said that corruption and communalism were the main causes of unemployment.

He said since unemployment breeds terrorism, the problem had to be tackled on priority.

Surjewala said that BJP-led NDA government had failed on all fronts right from Kargil war upto Parliament attack.

Even by deploying forces on border and then withdrawing them in cowardly manner caused a loss of over Rs 8,000 crore to state exchequer, he said, adding that the NDA government was marked with infamous scandals and scams.

5,Cong minister faces BJP blitz,"PATHANKOT: The war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress in Sujanpur reached a flashpoint on Saturday with former BJP minister Satya Pal Saini maintaining â€˜â€˜illegal land-grabbingâ€™â€™ charges against son of housing and urban development minister Raghunath Sahai Puri and the latter threatening to file a defamation case against Saini on Saturday for leading a campaign to sully his image.

The allegations of â€˜â€˜illegal land transactionsâ€™â€™ against Puriâ€™s son have been much talked about in this city following the police registering cases against more than eight colonisers in Pathankot and Gurdaspur and a story in an English daily published from Chandigarh quoting Pathankot Congress MLA Ashok Sharma alleging Puriâ€™s son, who is a property dealer, misusing his fatherâ€™s power and position and indulging in illegal property transactions.

Even as Ashok Sharma has denied having said anything â€˜â€˜derogatoryâ€™â€™ against Puri or his son and asked the newspaper to publish a corrigendum in this regard, the damage has been already done. One Congress MLA levelling charges of corruption against another Congress minister, as suggested by the newspaper report, proved a handy stick for Saini to beat his rival Puri with, who has been playing it to the hilt by distributing the copies of the newspaper story from door to door â€˜â€˜highlightingâ€™â€™ corruption charges against the housing minister.

Both Saini and Sujanpur MC president Vinay Mahajan have been also charging Puri for influencing the administration for large-scale irregularities in voting list and propping his â€˜â€˜property dealerâ€™â€™ son as a possible candidate for the Sujanpur MC presidentship in the coming poll. The problem was further compounded when Saini, in a statement on Saturday, demanded a â€˜â€˜high-level probe against illegal deals Puriâ€™s sonâ€™â€™ on Saturday.

Saini said: â€˜â€˜Chief minister Amarinder Singh, who has been promising transparency in the adminstration and eradication of corruption the government, should come clean about his Cabinet colleagues by launching probe into Puriâ€™s black deedsâ€™â€™.

7,ISI doubles incentives to step up terror: Report,"NEW DELHI: Pakistanâ€™s intelligence agency ISI has doubled the money for terrorist organisations as an inducement to continue strikes in India. Every militant outfit has been directed to maintain its launching detachment unit along the Line of Control (LoC) under the strict supervision of ISI officials.

According to a report submitted to the government, the ISI has set up a Refugee Maintenance Cell (RMC), which provides daily allowances to militants of every outfit.

Quoting interrogations of several Pakistani militants arrested by security forces, the report said, the RMC was headed by a retired Pakistani Colonel identified as Abdul Rehman.

Rehman, who had earlier served in Bangladesh, is also in-charge of providing additional allowances to militants staying in refugee camps. Those staying in these camps are shown to the world community as migrants from Jammu and Kashmir.

The amount spent on launching militant detachments into the Valley is also taken from operational money the report said; adding that every outfit has its launching detachments located along the LoC under supervision of ISI officials.

As per the new funding formula, small militant outfits like Al-Barq get Rs 7 lakh per month for their operational expenses while larger outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen are paid nearly Rs 50 lakh per month.

The money is handed over to the outfit''s branch in Pakistan and they find ways to send it across the border to their cadres.

The report also states that in order to maintain an easy flow of money into the Valley, the ISI has enlisted several Dubai-based businessmen who pass on monetary assistance to militant groups.

Operational money is being paid to militant outfits by one Brigadier positioned in a camp ''Hamza'' at Rawalpindi.

Separate funds are being given by the ISI to run Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir besides a large amount of money was also passed on the separatist leaders in Jammu and Kashmir to pay to the victims of violence.

Earlier a senior Hurriyat leader had come under attack for swindling money to the tune of crores of rupees meant for disbursement to the violence affected families.

According to the report, the Hizbul Mujahideen is the only organisation, which gets funds from Jamaat-e-Ialami of Pakistan in addition to what gets from the ISI. The Hizb is also the only organisation which, besides other benefits, is provided with Rs 500 as personal expenses to each of its militant cadre.

The RMC has also increased the maintenance money to various terrorist outfits from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per militant besides diverting the money from operational expenses of the ISI, the report said.

8,RBI to continue with soft monetary policy: Jalan,"PUNE: The Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan on Monday said that the apex bank will continue with its soft monetary policy stance and that the inflation outlook in the country is good.

""Inflation outlook is good, very benign and despite the high oil prices and drought it is at a historical low of around 3.5 per cent, which is very unusual"", Jalan said on the sidelines of the National Institute of Bank Management''s annual day function.

Asked about the interest rate outlook given the tame inflation and huge foreign exchange inflows, he said it was expected to be benign.

Referring to the repo rate, Jalan said as and when necessary it would be changed but there is no proposal to cut the rate as of now and the yields are for the market to decide.

On the bank rate, which is the lowest since 1973, he said no change is planned till the end of the current fiscal.

On surplus liquidity in the market due to foreign inflows, the RBI Governor said management of this excess inflow posed a problem. The foreign exchange reserves as in the last week of December had crossed US dollar 70 billion.

""Any repayment of external debt is for the government to decide and I think they have already repaid some amount"", he added.

9,Shourie meets industry on measures to improve investment,"NEW DELHI: In a meeting convened by Commerce and Industry Minister Arun Shourie, the issues like lowering interest rates and the need to build upon the improved investment climate in the country were discussed.

Meeting was called on Monday with an aim to sought suggestions of the industry on measures needed to remove bottlenecks and facilitate further investment.

""There is a recongnition that investment climate has improved. But we need to build up on that. Monday''s meeting was called to discuss additional measures to improve this further,"" he said.

The meeting, attended by representatives of the industry chambers - CII, FICCI and Assocham - focussed on some of the industry''s key areas of concern including the anomaly in the duty structure, particularly the higher interest rates on raw materials over finished products.

There was also concern that taxation as a percentage of production was extremely high in India. For instance in the case of cement, the duty burden in Malaysia was zero per cent, in China 17 per cent while in India it was 60 per cent.

Emphasising the necessity for Government to enhance spending in infrastructure, the meeting highlighted the need to tap new sources of funds such as pension funds to finance infrastructure projects.

However, the industry pointed out that unless revenue generating avenues such as imposition of user charges was strictly enforced by the Government, the infrastructure projects would become unviable and funds pumped into these projects would become non-performing assets.

10,HC seeks report from govts in Veerappan case,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday sought reports from the Centre, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka governments about the action taken by them to nab elusive forest brigand Veerappan.

A bench comprising Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice S K Agrawal directed the Union and the governments of the two states to submit details by February 11 as to what action has been taken by them so far to catch the sandalwood smuggler.

Allowing the request by Centre''s standing counsel Jayant Bhushan and counsel for Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to give them some more time to file replies, the court specifically asked Karnataka government about its initiatives as Veerappan''s latest activities were confined to its territory.

The court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking initiation of concrete steps to apprehend Veerappan after it had issued notices to the Centre, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on December 10.

The PIL, filed by K G Dhananjayan Chauhan also sought a probe into former Karnataka DGP C Dinakar''s allegations that Rs 20 crore were paid to Veerappan by the state government to secure the release of Kannada cine star Rajkumar from his clutches two years ago.

Dinakar made the allegations in his recently published book -- Veerappan''s Prize Catch: Rajkumar.

Former state minister H Nagappa, who was kidnapped by Veerappan in August last year, was found shot dead in Satyamangalam forests on December 8 after a 107-day captivity.

11,Warring Bihar Samata factions rule out split,"PATNA: Warring factions of the Bihar unit of the Samata Party on Monday ruled out the possibility of a split in the party but stopped short of calling a truce.

Samata national General Secretary Satish Kumar of the pro-Nitish Kumar faction, which has called a meeting of the state executive committee on January 19 despite it being declared unconstitutional by state Samata President Raghunath Jha, ruled out any chances of a split in a press conference. State Samata legislature party leader Umashanker Singh also told reporters separately that there would be no split.

However, Satish Kumar, MLA, declared that the January 19 meeting called to discuss important organisational matters would take place at any cost as it had the sanction of Railway Minister Nitish Kumar.

Satish Kumar, who was also part of the NDA delegation that submitted a memorandum to the Governor V C Pande, told reporters that the meeting would take place despite it being declared unconstituional by state party President, Raghunath Jha and national spokesman Shambhu Srivastava as it had the sanction of the undisputed leader of party, Nitish Kumar.

Kumar, who along with state vice-president Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj, had walked out of the NDA meeting here on January two chaired by the NDA convenor George Fernandes after lodging their protest over not inviting the Railway Minister, said any Samata leader showing disrespect to Nitish Kumar will have no place in the party.

When asked to comment on his sacking of the state spokesman P K Sinha, MLC, which had been declared null and void by the state president, Kumar said, ""I, being a national general secretary, am fully competent and justified in taking such a measure as Sinha is hand in glove with RJD President Laloo Prasad Yadav"".

""After removing Sinha on January two, I spoke to Nitishji and he justified my action,"" he said.

Sinha, on the other hand, said he had been removed by ""fake"" leaders having no locus standi and claimed he continued to be the spokesman.

Sinha claimed that since he had been appointed by national president George Fernandes, he alone was competent to remove him.

Samata legislature party leader Umashanker Singh, considered close to Fernandes, shared Sinha''s view and described the action against him as violative of the party constitution.

Singh also ruled out the possibility of a split in the party over the issue of convening the meeting of the state executive and said he would leave for New Delhi later this evening where he would apprise Fernandes of the developments in the state party.

""It is an internal matter of the party which will be sorted out amicably.....And there will be no split,"" he said.

12,Cong flays Kamath's selection as Prasar Bharti chief,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday criticised the choice of columnist M V Kamath as Chairman of the Prasar Bharati Board saying it was one more ""blatant"" attempt to influence Doordarshan and All India Radio.

""We, as a political party, totally disapprove this selection... We express our shock and dismay at the selection of Kamath as the new chairman of the Prasar Bharti Board"", party spokesman S Jaipal Reddy told reporters.

Opposing the choice, he said Kamath has been noted for his brazen ""pro-BJP"" bias reflected in his writings over the years, his choice for the post was ""one more attempt to influence DD/AIR which were clothed with autonomy under Prasar Bharti Act"".

""Since the BJP could not undo the Prasar Bharti Act, they are trying to capture it through sabotage and subverting the spirit of the institution"", he said and added the whole idea behind the act was to run the Board by people with independent understanding of politics and other matters"".

Deploring the decision, he said the name (Kamath) as such was not to command approval from across the political spectrum.
