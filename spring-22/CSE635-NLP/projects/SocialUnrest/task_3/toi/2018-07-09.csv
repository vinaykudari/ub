0,"Row between CPM leaders, sports minister deepens","kolkata: the simmering tension between the west bengal cpm leadership and maverick sports and transport minister subhas chakroborty reached a new height on sunday. in a tersely worded statement, state cpm secretary anil biswas refuted chakroborty's charges that a section of the party had 'conspired' to implicate him in the salt lake stadium fiasco. ""various media have carried report quoting the minister subhas chakroborty that a section of the cpm party is conspiring on the salt lake stadium issue. i want to make it clear catagorically that the allegation of conspiracy is a figment of imagination. none of our party is involved in that,"" said biswas in the statement. censoring the controversial senior minister in black and white, biswas also asked him to stop his tirade against the top guns of the state party. ""no minister will be allowed to make statements or give television interviews except on the issues related to his department,"" said the party diktat. while chakroborty's immediate reaction was not available, he, along with wife ramola, was found attending the most politically correct function in the morning at salt lake's indira bhavan. the resident of the sprawling bunglow, former chief minister and cpm politburo member jyoti basu turned 88 on sunday. while basu's successor buddhadeb bhattacharjee and politburo member biman basu was conspicious by their absence, the high profile chakroborty couple took the opportunity to reiterate their 'total faith' in the sagacity of the marxist partriarch. ""jyotibabu is the epitome of party discipline as he accepted the party's decision not to join the central government despite his personal reservation about the decision,"" recalled subhas. ironically, time and again chakraborty has been charged with violation of the party discipline for firing salvos against the state party leadership before the assembly polls. chakraborty was accused of harbouring criminals following the arrest of some history-sheeters from the salt lake stadium, known as the minister's fiefdom. while the party has refused to stand by him by calling it an issue to be cleared by the government, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee virtually put his senior minister on the dock by seeking his explanation on how the criminals got 'shelter' in the stadium. infuriated, subhas shot back by alleging a conspiracy against him which he felt a part of the vilification campaign launched to clip his wings further on the eve of the party organisational conferences.

1,Manipur faces political uncertainty,"imphal/kolkata: in the midst of the big question if the ceasefire agreement betweeen the national socialist council of nagaland (isak-muivah) and the centre is going to be extended to manipur or not, a smaller uncertainty that the state faces is if the old assembly is going to be revived and a government formed. after parliament was convened on july 23, the centre would have to get the decision to impose president's rule in manipur ratified. political leaders in imphal thought this would be difficult, because the congress might refuse this in the rajya sabha. ""i think the centre's plan will be to install a government in manipur,"" bjp leader bhuban singh said on sunday. he was not sure, however, even if a government was installed, whether it would be able to function. ""people are quite angry,"" singh agreed, and said they might refuse a government to function if the same set of mlas formed them. political leaders still recalled the incidents on june 18, when the assembly building, the speaker's residence and that of some other mlas were attacked and burnt. most of the mlas were still camping in delhi, ostensibely to hold meetings with the prime minister and the union home minister and have the ceasefire agreement without a geographical boundary rescinded. observers said that it would be a blessing in disguise for the centre if the mlas resigned so that the assembly could be dissolved. ""otherwise, there may be a deadlock."" ""people will not allow the same mlas to form the government,"" a senior journalist based in imphal said. all manipur united clubs organisation leader n. sanajaoba thought, however, that it was better to have an elected government in the state than president's rule. ""a popular government is better than president's rule,"" he said in kolkata recently. bjp leader singh, too, had said in an earlier interview with the toins that ""the installation of an elected government will help us to fight the central policies better."" he had cited the instances of assam and arunachal pradesh, where chief ministers tarun gogoi and mukut mithi had taken a lead in protesting against the decision of the centre in extending the ceasefire with the nscn (i-m) to parts of these two states. singh agreed that the state bjp was in a dilemma in manipur because the bjp-led government at the centre had taken the lead in the controversial decision on ceasefire extension. ""centre's chief negotiator padmanavaiah's reporting must have influenced advani's decision,"" he had observed. people of manipur were angry with the mlas because they thought while the centre was planning to extend the ceasefire in nagaland to manipur, the people's representatives were involved in petty quarrels for power. ""before the promulgation of the president's rule, either the bjp and the samata party could have formed the government, but both decided to stay away,"" an observer said.

2,BJP lashes at state govt for fund mismanagement,"mumbai: bjp in maharashtra on sunday accused the democratic front government in the state of not utilising the central funds for various developmental projects. ""various developmental projects in maharashtra have failed to take off as the state government is not utilising monetary assistance from the centre"", bjp national vice-president gopinath munde told reporters about the economic resolution passed at the party's state executive meeting, that concluded at dombivali in neighbouring thane district. though the state government is criticising the centre for not assisting it financially, it is the former that has failed to utilise union government's funds, munde alleged. the bonds floated by df government have failed to evoke much response from the investors and the state's credibility has gone down during this government's rule, the bjp leader claimed. the national economic development rate, which is usually lower than that of the state's, has surpassed the latter during the df government's regime, he said. munde charged the df government of ""appeasing minorities"" by taking action against the former city police chief r d tyagi in connection with the police firing during the 1992-93 communal flare up. earlier, union parliamentary minister pramod mahajan supported the shiv sena supremo bal thackeray's statement that saffron combine alliance can storm back to power by aligning with the nationalist congress party (ncp). ""it is a good proposal but we will have to wait for the ncp's response"", he told media persons.
