0,Panel to probe riots up to Apr 30,"AHMEDABAD: The state government has restricted the terms of reference of the judicial inquiry commission into the riots as only up to April 30.

A notification on June 3 had limited the inquiry of riots to incidents between February 27 and March 30. However, another notification issued on June 6, rectified the same and changed the terms of inquiry as between February 27 and April 30.

The government on March 6 had appointed justice KG Shah Commission to conduct an inquiry and submit its report in three months.

On May 21, the government reconstitued the Commission ''in public interest'' and appointed retired Supreme Court judge justice GT Nanavati to chair the commission.

Until now it has received 2,825 application affidavits. A special waiver has been given by the state and the High Court on notarial expenses and registration fees for filing affidavits before the commission.

""The registrars of the district courts are accepting and forwarding affidavits, thus saving the expenditure for individuals"" said justice Shah.

He said that the commission has also extended the deadline for filing written statements several times and has set it at July 1.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a public hearing was held by the commission to deal with procedural aspects. Justice Nanavati said that the hearing was aimed at streamlining the process to gather and consider evidence filed before the commission.

Nearly 30 applicants turned up, some accompanied by their advocates to represent before the commission the problems they were facing and their pleas.

However, the public hearing to discuss evidence and incidents will be held later.

Appearing on behalf of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee senior advocate Magan Barot raised a preliminary objection about the commission, pointing at the case pending in the Gujarat High Court against re-constitution of the court.

Advocate Vijay Patel appeared on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party and made submissions on procedures to be adopted by the commission, about the languages and about examination of the submissions.

1,BSP-BJP split over quota policy,"LUCKNOW: Leaders of the two important constituents of the government, the BSP and the BJP, still hold different views on reservation to dalits and backwards.

Whether reservation should be on the basis of decisions taken by the Mayawati government on May 31, 2002, or it should follow the spirit of ati-pichhda and ati-dalit reservation Act of 2001, effected by the Rajnath Singh government, is the bone of contention between the leadership of the two parties.

This dichotomy in approach became public on Tuesday morning when Satish Pal, a prominent BJP leader, organised dharna under the banner of Samajik Nyaya Morcha, demanding annulment of reservation laws passed by the cabinet on May 31, 2002. Instead, he pleaded for job reservation on the basis of the reservation Act of 2001.

Interestingly, former chief minister Rajnath Singh felt that the reservation policy enacted by his government meant to uplift the plight of dalits and backwards. He said the reservation based on the social justice committeeâ€™s report was in the larger interests of the people.

Meanwhile, BJP spokesman Hridaynarain Dixit said on Tuesday that the party had nothing to do with the dharna organised by the Samajik Nyaya Morcha. He, however, admitted that Satish Pal was a member of the BJP.

The Morcha later submitted a memorandum to governor Vishnukant Shastri. In the memorandum the morcha said that the government should effectively speak in favour of the reservation policy passed by the cabinet in 2001 before the Supreme Court.

The Samajik Nyaya Morcha has asked the government to keep backward castes away from the purview of the creamy layer and distribute gram sabha lands to them.

3,"Arsenic in veggies, not grains: Govt","KOLKATA: Arsenic has been found in leafy vegetables, but not in foodgrains, state water investigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya said in the Assembly on Tuesday.

In reply to a question from Trinamul Congress member Saugata Roy, the minister admitted that arsenic deposits had been detected in the roots of paddy plants in arsenic-affected districts.

â€œBut as one goes up the plants, the arsenic deposit reduces significantly and at the grain level there is no arsenic deposit,â€� Bhattacharya claimed. These, he revealed, were the findings of an interim report prepared by a committee of experts from Kalyani University and the National Bureau of Soil Survey. Another interim report of the committee will be made available before the final report is placed.

Bhattacharya also said there was no report of anyone suffering arsenic poisoning from foodgrains.

Ground water in 75 blocks of the state is contaminated with arsenic while that of three other blocks by flouride, the minister revealed. In north Bengal, except parts of Malda, there is no report of arsenic contamination. However, in south Bengal, arsenic contamination is a growing menace. Besides, the water table too has gone down here.

The state government is encouraging the use of surface water together with ground water in cultivation to minimise the impact of arsenic in foodgrains, the minister informed. For the past two year, a filter developed in Germany is also being tried out in Murshidabad and Nadia.

Besides, a programme for artificial recharging of ground water aquifers has also been taken up.

This involves the collection of rain water, which is allowed to flow underground to reduce arsenic contents and to bring up the ground water level.

4,Minister stages dharna against govt,"DHANBAD: Has the government machinery failed completely in Jharkhand? The answer to this question is in affirmative if one goes by the action of Jharkhand science and technology minister Samaresh Singh, who sat on a day-long dharna here on Monday to raise his grievances against the government.

To express their anguish over the rampant corruption in development works and failure of the government to take the benefits of a cash-rich state to the doorsteps of the poor, activists of Jharkhand Vananchal Congress (JVC) led by science and technology minister Samaresh Singh sat on a day-long dharna at Randhir Verma Chowk here on Monday. An 18-point charter of demands was later submitted to the DC which included abolition of corruption from the development works, revival of Sindri fertiliser factory, increasing the old age pension to Rs 300, payment of minimum wages to the daily wage employees in government departments, including the BIT Sindri which falls under his ministry, and sprinkling of bleaching powder in the wells and ponds.

Addressing the public on the occasion, the minister alleged that the Marandi government (in which he is a minister) has utterly failed in taking the benefits of a cash surplus state to the poor and the money meant for the development of the state is yet to bring a change in the life of the public in general. The government is spending crores on developmental projects, like roads and handpumps, but the middlemen and bureaucrats are gobbling up most of the money. There is rampant corruption in almost all government departments but there is none to check it. Similarly, there is no system to evaluate the quality of the work being done, he alleged.

5,Accidental death or suicide?,"KOLKATA: A second-year computer science student at B.E. College, Shibpur, was tragically killed at the Rabindra Sadan Metro railway station on Monday afternoon when he fell on the tracks and failed to get up before an incoming train mowed him down.

While Metro officials insisted that 22-year-old Aveek Tarafdar from Ashu Ghosh lane, Paikpara, had committed suicide, both the Metro driver and eyewitness accounts maintained that the boy was struggling to get up from the track when the train rushed into the station.

â€œI saw the boy on the tracks and I could see him struggling,â€� recalled the driver T.K. Samaddar. But, he added, the train at that point had a speed of 40 kilometres per hour and realising that emergency brakes would not work, he applied normal brakes. It was, however, a little too late.

The train mowed the boy before stopping.

Eyewitness, Haripada Bhar, claimed that he had spotted the boy standing close to the track and watching the World Cup football match on the television sets installed at the platform. Bhar himself was intent in watching the game and was startled by a scream.

He turned round to see the boy desperately trying to pull himself up. But before people could react, to their horror, they found the train rushing in. P.K. Chatterjee, chief manager (operations), however, claimed that it was a clear case of suicide because the televisions screens were all â€˜centrally placedâ€� and there was at least an 8 to 10 feet gap between the platform and the screen. The deceased, Chatterjee pointed out, could watch the screen from a safe distance and on Monday afternoon there were not too many people.

This could be the first â€˜accidentalâ€™ death in the Metro since its inception in 1984. But in case of a suicide, Metro Railway authorities said, this would be the 81st at tempt, 37 out of which have succeeded so far. Telecast of World Cup matches has been a source of attraction at the stations and there was apprehension that the crowd could have contributed to the accident by forcing the deceased to try and get to a vantage position, thereby, falling.

6,3 BSP MLAs inducted as ministers,"PATNA: Three BSP MLAs were inducted into the Rabri Devi ministry on Tuesday amid conflicting statements about their status.

Even as the groupâ€™s leader Mahabali Singh, who took oath as a cabinet minister, swore his allegiance to BSP supremo Kanshi Ram, AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar affairs Oscar Fernandes, who met RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav on Tuesday morning, said he had been informed that the three MLAs had deserted the BSP. â€œThere is no dilution of secularism,â€� stressed Fernandes while referring to the ministry expansion. Two other BSP MLAs â€” Rajesh Singh and Chhedi Lal Paswan â€” were sworn in as ministers of state.

Laloo himself was reluctant to say if the BSP MLAs had deserted their party. â€œWe are ready to welcome anybody who comes forward to strengthen secularism,â€� he maintained. However, he refused to make a categorical statement on the â€œdesertionâ€� by the BSP MLAs to join the Rabri ministry.

Mahabali himself made conflicting statements about their status. Earlier on the electronic media, he stated that the BSP MLAs had not taken the consent of Kanshi Ram. Later, an agency report said Mahabali, who is also the BSP state president, had taken the consent of Kanshi Ram before joining the ministry. Mahabali observed that since a resolution passed by the BSPâ€™s Bihar unit in early May urging Kanshi Ram to grant permission to withdraw support from the Rabri government had not been heeded, it was â€œpresumedâ€� that Kanshi Ram wanted them to join the ministry!

Initially, the Congress expressed its anger over not being consulted about the ministry expansion. Congress legislature party leader Vijay Shankar Dubey said the ministry expansion without consultation was against the spirit of Congress-RJD agreement. However, Fernandes played down the issue in his press conference at the state guest house barely half an hour before the swearing-in.

The swearing-in proved to be a low-key affair with not a single NDA leader attending it. Only three Congress ministers were present. The state assembly Speaker and legislative council chairman were also absent. The seats reserved for judges were vacant. The followers of RJD MLC Subhash Yadav dominated the show while RJD MLA Sadhu Yadav was conspicuous by his absence. Chief secretary S N Biswas committed a faux pas by addressing Mahabali Singh as Rajbali Singh.

RJD sources indicated that the expansion has left several ministerial aspirants like Ramanand Yadav and Jai Prakash Yadav frustrated. â€œThe RJD supremo has told his followers that there would be another expansion after the assembly session,â€� remarked a ruling party minister.

RJD sources say with the success in the case of BSP, Laloo may start poaching in other parties, including the JD(U), to consolidate further the position of Rabri ministry even without Congress support.

7,Encounters threaten govt-naxal talks,"HYDERABAD: Breaking their one-month-old cease-fire, the police and the Peopleâ€™s War (PW) naxalites exchanged fire at Elinetiguda village in Jannaram police station limits in Adilabad on Tuesday morning.

However, no casualties were reported from either side during the hourlong gun battle.

The police recovered two kit bags, one revolver, one single-bore gun, and a selfloading rifle magazine from the encounter site.

According to superintendent of police Mahesh M Bhagawat of Adilabad district, a police team conducting a routine search operation sighted a platoon of PW fighters operating in the area around 5 am on Tuesday.

A fierce engagement commenced with the two groups spending hundreds of rounds of automatic weapons fire.

This is the first encounter between the police and the naxalites since the PW declared a unilateral cease-fire for one month beginning May 10.

When the truce lapsed on June 10, the PW did not formally announce an extension and the police resumed â€˜routineâ€™ operations.

Tuesdayâ€™s encounter may jeopardise the third-round of talks between the government and PW, scheduled for June 20.

Meanwhile, the Peace Initiative Committee (PIC) has appealed to both the government and the PW to finalise immediately the framework for the talks.

8,MLA arrested for threatening principal,"HYDERABAD: The Abids police on Tuesday arrested Congress MLA D Nagender on charges of intimidating Nizam College principal P Uma Maheshwar Reddy.

According to the police, the MLA allegedly barged into the principalâ€™s chambers on Saturday and used abusive language for not admitting a candidate recommended by him.

The principal later lodged a complaint with the Abids police.

The principal claimed that Nagender made a forced entry into his room and threatened him with dire consequences if he refused to give admission to one N D Jai Shanker Goud of Qutubullahpur into first year B.Com.

Deputy commissioner of police (central) C V Anand said the MLA has been booked under Section 353 (preventing a public servant from discharging his duties) and Section 506 of IPC (criminal intimidation).

Nagender was later granted bail.

Meanwhile, the Nizam college unit of Osmania University Teachersâ€™ Association has condemned the Congress MLAâ€™s behaviour and sought action against him.

10,Govt has failed in foreign policy: VHP,"KANPUR: The government has failed on foreign policy and is functioning as a face saver, International Joint Secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Onkar Bhave has said .

The government should have retaliated against Pakistan after the attack on Parliament but instead they had lifted the airspace ban on Pakistani aircraft and withdrawn its naval warships. This seemed to show that the government was functioning under pressure of some big power, he told reporters on Wednesday.

He said that the Union government could not do anything even when Indian displomats were assaulted in Pakistan.

Bhave also alleged that the Centre was creating hurdles in the way of construction of Rama temple at Ayodha rather than facilitating its construction.

The BJP graph had declined as the party had abandoned the Hindutva agenda, he said.

However, he congratulated the government for doing a remarkable job by collecting the support of various Opposition parties for the NDA''s presidential candidate A P J Abdul Kalam.

Bhave said the VHP would discuss the outcome of the decision taken by the meetings of saints and Rama Temple Marg Darshan Mandal of June 22 and June 23 at its ranchi meeting on July 6-7. He said that Parishad would take up the issue of Mathura and Kashi later on.

The minister informed that BJP MLA Girish Mahajan, who was detained by the police in connection with the riots on Tuesday, was released on Wednesday.

Thakre, who was accompanied by senior officials, told reporters later that Rs two lakh would be given as compensation to the next of kin of those killed in the riot.

12,Man arrested with wives for rape,"MUMBAI: Three years after the ghastly crime, a 55-year-old man was arrested along with two wives, on charges of raping his minor niece for three months and forcing her to abort her foetus, at Dombivali in north-east Mumbai, police said today.

The wives of the accused were held on charges of abetting the crime, they said adding the accused Babulal Yadav and his wives have been remanded to police custody by a local court till June 20.

The minor girl had come to her uncle''s house to spend her holidays where she was repeatedly raped by Yadav with one of his wives Mangala helping out in the crime, they said.

The accused''s wife was fully aware of what the girl was being put through but did little to prevent it, police said.

When the girl got pregnant, the duo immediately summoned the second wife Dharmaraja Devi from their native place and the three administered the girl certain drugs to abort the foetus, which was later disposed off in a nearby creek.

The girl, who remained silent after being threatened of dire consequences, however, mustered courage to reveal the crime after her recent marriage, following which her husband lodged an FIR with the police, leading to the arrests on Saturday, they said.

13,Jalgaon riots leave 5 dead,"JALGAON: The toll in communal violence in Jamner mounted to five with two more deaths reported on Wednesday even as the government ordered a magisterial inquiry into the disturbances in the north Maharashtra town, which is under indefinite curfew since Tuesday night.

One Gulab Shaikh, who was injured in stone-pelting by the mob on Tuesday, died early on Wednesday while an unidentified matador driver was set afire by miscreants at Pimpalgaon Golai, 5 km from Jamner, police said, adding the situation was tense but under control.

Three persons, including a five-month-old girl, were killed and 23 others injured in the violence and subsequent police firing following clashes between two groups over arrest of a person on June 15 for his alleged involvement in desecration of a Hanuman idol.

Police fired eight rounds to disperse the mob, which set afire shops and houses at Gandhi Chowk, Shrirampeth Pachora, Nagarkhana, Mahavir Marg and Jamnerpura localities.

Girish Mahajan, a BJP MLA, who was detained by police on Tuesday night for his alleged role in triggering the riots, was let off early on Wednesday, police said.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for Home Manikrao Thakre, who visited the riot-affected areas on Wednesday morning, ordered a magisterial enquiry to ascertain cause of the disturbances. He urged people to remain calm and assist local administration in restoring normalcy, official sources said.

14,Delhi govt threatens to demolish cell towers,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi administration has sent shivers down the spine of the city''s cellular operators by slapping a notice on them threatening to pull down their ''illegal'' cell sites.

All the four companies - Bharti Cellular (Airtel), Hutchison Essar (Hutch), Idea Cellular (which is awaiting spectrum allocation to launch its service), and the state-run MTNL (Dolphin for GSM-based wireless telephony and Garuda for CDMA-based WLL) - have been posted notices in the past few days, asking them to pull down their cell sites from private residential buildings.

The companies have requested for a meeting with the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi, Vijai Kapoor, in an attempt to settle the issue. The meeting may take place on Friday.

Each of these sites comprises a dish antenna and associated equipment like boosters which are meant to strengthen the carriage of radio signals used by the service provider. Setting them up is a time-consuming affair, involving as it does lease agreements with property owners and payment of hefty advance rent towards use of their property in commercial and non-commercial areas.

Cellular operators have also paid out large amounts to erect towers atop the buildings which are not highrisers.

Senior company executives at Essar Hutchison and Bharti Cellular alleged that the notices were a ploy to arm-twist their companies into making irregular payments to secure clearances. The fact, however, is that Delhi''s building by-laws do not permit commercial activity in residential buildings, except in the case of essential or emergency services.

That could put the cellular operators - as well as their customers - in a spot. ""In case a settlement is not reached, these sites now run the risk of being brought down by the demolition squads of MCD and NDMC, resulting in disruption of services,"" says a senior manager at one of the service providers.

Bharti Cellular has kept the number of its sites in residential buildings low. Although the exact number of residential cell sites was not immediately available, Bharti and Essar Hutchison have over 300 sites in Delhi and neighbouring areas like Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurgaon. Idea has so far set up between 250 and 275 cell sites.

15,Lashkar militant arrested in Punjab,"LUDHIANA: Punjab police have arrested a Lashkar-e-Taiba militant, a Pakistani national, who was kingpin of a gang which had carried out a series of attacks and explosions killing 24 people in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, a top police official said on Wednesday.

Abdul, hailing from Karachi, was the main coordinator of the LeT in Punjab since 1997 and had headed the four-member gang which attacked an Army camp in Himachal killing three army personnel and caused the Doraha train blast which claimed three lives in Punjab, state police chief M S Bhullar told reporters here.

Four army personnel were injured in the attack on the army camp and 29 were injured in the Doraha blast, the DGP said adding it was Abdul who had planted the bomb in the running train on March 13 last.

Abdul was arrested yesterday, the DGP said but did not disclose the place from where he was taken into custody citing ""security reasons"".

Two of the three absconding members of Abdul''s gang were Pakistani nationals, Bhullar said. The gangmembers have been identified as Kammaludin alias Joginder Singh and Iqbal, both Pak nationals, and Rashid, a native of Jammu and Kashmir, he added.

Bhullar said 24 people were killed and 91 injured in various strikes carried out by the gang in the past few years. One 9 mm Czech made pistol, several rounds of ammunition, half-a-kg RDX and detonators were recovered from the arrested terrorist, he said.

Giving details of the modus operandi of the gang, he said they were trained to work as petty farm workers, domestic helps and sometimes even as rickshaw pullers. Abdul was doing all of these activities on routine basis in Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Hoshiarpur.

""They maintained contacts in Pakistan through phone and on wireless sets with Lahore-based LeT office to get directions,"" Bhullar said.

He said the terrorists were also responsible for an explosion near Jalandhar on March 14, 1997 in which seven people were killed and 22 injured. They had a hand in another explosion near Lamba village on June 28, 2000 in which two persons were killed and many injured. They were also responsible for a blast in a bus near Kartarpur in 2000 in which seven people were killed and 22 injured.

To carry out its operations in Punjab, LeT used Punjabi speaking Pak nationals who could easily mingle with the population here, he said.

16,3 traders arrested in income tax racket,"MUMBAI: In a case of alleged cheating, three persons have been arrested for submitting bogus documents to the income tax department to claim refund of Rs ten lakh tax amount paid in advance.

The trio, remanded to police custody by a magistrate, has been charged with conspiracy to cheat the Union government by submitting bogus documents.

They had allegedly fabricated income tax challans to show payment of income tax to the tune of Rs 10.11 lakh, sources said adding, subsequently, they made claims on the basis of challans for return of Rs 10.11 lakh paid as advance tax.

The accused had through their Chartered Accountant sent a letter to the Income Tax Authority asking for the return of Advance Tax. However, the authority, on checking the records, realised that no such payment had been made.

On interrogations, the three admitted that no such amount mentioned in the challans had been made, sources said.

17,Kalam remark a discomfort to govt,"NEW DELHI: Were it not for the context, it would have been scare-time in South Asia again. A P J Abdul Kalamâ€™s statement that â€˜â€˜if we did not have nuclear weapons, it (war) would have taken placeâ€™â€™ between India and Pakistan, was no different from General Pervez Musharrafâ€™s claim on Monday that Pakistanâ€™s nuclear deterrent had stopped India from attacking Pakistan.

The saving grace was that Kalamâ€™s statement was made as an aside in his first interaction with the media as a presidential candidate and not seen as a response to Musharraf.

In fact, the external affairs spokesperson on Tuesday had harsh things to say about the Pakistani Presidentâ€™s statement. In a statement, she accused Musharraf of â€˜â€˜loose talkâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜continued concoction of doomsday theory to justify Pakistanâ€™s use of nuclear blackmailâ€™â€™.

Kalamâ€™s brave defence of the nuclear deterrence that â€” â€˜â€˜this nuclear deterrent on both sides has helped not to engage in a big war and to avoid the nuclear warâ€™ â€” will discomfit the government since many in its top echelons believe that Pakistan has successfully deterred India from reacting to its â€˜proxyâ€™ or low-intensity war against India.

This has been the case for the past 11 years since Pakistan began supporting the militancy in the Kashmir Valley as well as during the Kargil conflict when Pakistani personnel crossed the Line of Control.

But India, which has a â€˜no-first useâ€™ policy, maintains that any reference to the nuclear issue in relation to Pakistan or Kashmir only serves to stoke fears of a nuclear war in South Asia and helps Pakistanâ€™s cause.

Top officials, including Prime Minister Vajpayee, have refused to directly comment on the issue and have made an effort to show that India is a responsible nation that refuses to indulge in any â€˜â€˜loose talkâ€™â€™ on such issues. In fact, South Block believes that it was Pakistanâ€™s sabre-rattling last month, including the missile tests that Musharraf lauded in his Mondayâ€™s remarks, that finally cooked Islamabadâ€™s goose.

It scared the US enough to send deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage to Islamabad to secure a pledge from Musharraf that Pakistan will â€˜â€˜permanently endâ€™â€™ cross-border terrorism.

19,Naidu mum on Vice-President election,"NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who had earlier queered the pitch for the BJPâ€™s presidential candidate, is learnt to have indicated that he may not raise any objection to the main NDA partner choosing its candidate for the Vice-Presidentâ€™s post.

Naidu, who flew into Delhi especially to be present when the NDAâ€™s presidential candidate A PJ Abdul Kalam filed his nomination papers on Tuesday, was reluctant to talk about the upcoming vice-presidentâ€™s election.

â€˜â€˜I will talk about it at the appropriate time,â€™â€™ he maintained, when asked about his choice for the Vice-Presidentâ€™s post. Naidu maintained that he had not even discussed this issue with the BJP leaders so far.

TDP sources said that having shot down the BJPâ€™s original presidential candidate P C Alexander, Naidu is quite understanding about the BJP wanting its own nominee as vice-president. The BJP, it is learnt, has also conveyed as much to Naidu.

However, TDP sources were also quick to clarify that this did not tantamount to an endorsement of just any BJP candidate. The TDP would prefer a more moderate person instead of a hardcore RSS candidate.

20,CM takes investments under his wing,"BANGALORE: In an effort to upgrade Karnataka''s image to match neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister S.M. Krishna will head the High Level Committee (HLC) on industrial investment, co-ordinating projects in five major sectors.

The HLC, which clears investment in industry, tourism, infrastructure, IT and agri-food, along with other industry sectors, has till date been chaired by Large and Medium Industries Minister R.V. Deshpande, with secretaries from all the concerned departments as members.

Industries sources pointed out that in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the CEO, Chandrababu Naidu, is very easily accessible to any and every investor. ""The idea is to take up the investment decisions to a higher level and make our CM equally accessible. We think it will bring in more investment,"" a top official stated.

Additional Chief Secretary (Commerce and Industries) B.S. Patil told The Times of India on Wednesday that the idea had been mooted an year ago as part of the industry deregulation programme. ""Since we decided that there will be just one clearing agency for industry, infrastructure, tourism, IT and agrifood processing, we felt that the CM heading it would give it more weight,"" he said.

In the same vein, it has been suggested that the chief secretary should head the Single Window Agency (SWA) which clears all projects below Rs 50 crore. The industries secretary had headed this committee till now.

""All these suggestions are there in our draft Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, which has now gone in the form of an ordinance to the Governor,"" Patil added.

Chief Secretary A. Ravindra has set the ball rolling by chairing a meeting of the SWA on June 17. ""We have had no problems with the co-ordination with other departments, so far. We are just improving the HLC''s image,"" Patil stated.

21,BKU sets new deadline for govt,"CHANDIGARH: The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), on Wednesday, set June 30 as the new deadline for the Haryana government to decide about its remaining demands, including a waiver for power arrears, failing which farmers would again start their agitation.

The decision was taken at the BKUâ€™s â€˜â€˜mahapanchayatâ€� held at Kandela village under the leadership of Ghasi Ram Nain, who had been spearheading the agitation since May 19.

The BKU called off its â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ stir on Monday in response to the acceptance of some of its demands by the government, including compensation to those killed or handicapped or injured in police firing during the month-long agitation.

The BKU came to the negotiating table only after the state government conceded to its demand for withdrawal of all the cases filed against its activists since 1992.

Talking to Times News Network on the phone from Kandela, Nain said that the farmers would not pay their present electricity bills till their power arrears were written off. â€˜â€˜The government has made a fool of us for too long. But now we have seen through its game and will not allow it to fool us,â€� said Nain, adding that it was for the government to find ways and means to write off power arrears.

Nain said he was also concerned over the manner in which farmers were harassed without trial in the event of their failure to pay back bank loans.

The government would have to think over this issue as well, said Nain, asserting that he had given a call to farmers to be ready for another phase of agitation in case the government backed out on its assurances given to him in the talks held on Monday.

The government is likely to invite farmers for further talks after chief minister Om Prakash Chautala returns from his foreign tour on June 28.

Two rounds of talks have already taken place between the BKU leadership led by Nain and finance minister Sampat Singh, who is heading the four-member committee constituted by the chief minister for the purpose.

The BKU decided to call off its â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitation after the second round of talks during which the government accepted its demand for compensation to those killed or handicapped in police firing or other incidents of violence during the month-long agitation.

The PIL, filed by Salekh Chand Jain, alleged that if the sale of liquor was liberalised even minors and schoolchildren would be able to buy it.

The excise policy, announced on June 15, had said that the sale of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) by private parties would be allowed and licences would be issued for opening more country-made liquor shops.

The government said this was intended to curb the smuggling and sale of spurious liquor.
