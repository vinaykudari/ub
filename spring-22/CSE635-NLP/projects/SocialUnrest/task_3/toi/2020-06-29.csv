0,"Needed, a growth-oriented IT policy","LUCKNOW: From the state with one of the highest per capita income at the time of independence then United Provinces), UP is now ranked somewhere at the bottom.

That, despite the fact that in agriculture, UP has the place of pride even today, being the largest producer of wheat (36 per cent), sugar 30.6 per cent) and potato (38 per cent). It has the largest livestock population and the highest milk production in India.

The main resources of UP include natural resources (fertile land and abundant water), human resources (large work force for agriculture and technical work force) and cultural resources places of historical and religious importance). Thus, the strength of agricultural base, consumption base and land-trained work force has to be leveraged to bring UP back to economic prosperity.

Fortunately, the contribution of service sector in the GNP of India is increasing in general and the share of IT & IT-enabled services and knowledge management services are significantly increasing in particular. Further, in IT exports, UP has been having a lionâ€™s share. It may surprise many but it is true that software exports from STP Noida is second only to STP Bangalore and is far ahead of Hyderabad.

India is well positioned to derive benefits from the IT-enabled services market and become a key hub for these services. The countryâ€™s strength in the form of low staff costs, large pool of skilled, Englishspeaking work force, conducive policy environment and with certain additional Government support makes India a popular choice for customers seeking outsourcing services. All these factors are perhaps more true for mainland UP (Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Agra, Meerut).

In order to make mainland UP an IT hub, an integrated approach is needed, involving (i) setting up appropriate IT infrastructure, (ii) building up appropriate growthoriented IT policy by the Government of UP for creating conducive environment for the IT industry, (iii) sensitising decision-makers, potential investors, entrepreneurs and key users about IT, its usage and business potential and (iv) creating self-help groups of IT organisations in the state to achieve a faster growth.

IT infrastructure, basically needed for IT industry, should have uninterrupted power supply good quality and providing reliable continuous faster connectivity at cheaper cost. It may be interesting to note that the cost of connectivity in UP is comparatively higher than the states like Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and AP.

Specific suggestions for creating appropriate IT infrastructure are setting up IT clusters with uninterrupted quality power supply necessary, a small captive power generation plant can be made part of the cluster), providing minimum of 16 Mbps connectivity with at least one building, say, around 25,000 square feet area ready to move, plug and operate for IT entrepreneurs. These IT clusters should be near to airports and should be set up with the earth stations for reliable connectivity.

part of these IT clusters, land plots may be made available to software companies to set up IT-oriented business activity. Perhaps, one the ideal location will be around Lucknow-Kanpur highway and making Lucknow-Kanpur highway as â€˜IT Corridorâ€™. (To be concluded) (The author is MD, UPTEC Computer Consultancy Ltd)

1,"Enjoying 'power' of electing CM, minister","LUCKNOW: Even as the state capital sees increasing raids to check power thefts, districts like Saharanpur and Hathras, having the benefit of voting chief minister Mayawati and energy minister Ramveer Upadhyay to power ,are largely overlooked.

Figures reveal that in April and May, while there have been 1,999 raids in Lucknow, a poor 521 raids have been conducted in Aligarh, comprising Hathras , Aligarh proper and Etah while CMâ€™s constituency Saharanpur, witnessed 969 raids. In Lucknow, 930 connections were snapped but the number of disconnections in the entire Aligarh was a meagre 89. Similarly, in Saharanpur, they were much less than Luknow â€” mere 164.

And, what of the number of FIRs and arrests? While a total of 523 FIRs were lodged in Lucknow, the number in Aligarh was 46 and in Saharanpur just 55.Moreover, compared to 326 arrests in Lucknow, there have been only 27 in Aligarh and 23 in Saharanpur. And all this protection to Saharanpur and Hathras, despite the fact that these areas top the defaultersâ€™ list.

According to a Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) report, identifying 20 divisions with the highest â€˜Aggregate Technical and Commercialâ€™ (AT&C) losses, EDD-2 Hathras tops the list with 78.01 per cent AT&C losses. EDD-2 Saharanpur, with 74.03 per cent AT&C losses, is a close second. EDD-1 Saharanpur and EDD-1 Hathras also figure in the list of top 20 defaulters , with 67.72 per cent and 65.7 per cent AT&C losses respectively.

According to the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC), â€œThe AT&C losses, defined as the difference between energy against which payment has been collected and energy purchase as a percentage to the total energy purchased, presents a â€˜grimâ€™ picture.â€�

CMD UPPCL Arun Kumar Misra, however, says that these figures were limited to the raids conducted by the â€˜specialisedâ€™ vigilance squads.The UPPCLâ€™s administrative wings conduct separate raids with the help of local police in different districts. However, district-wise figures of such raids were available neither with the CMD nor with the director commercial officer, Udai Narayan.

For the AT&C losses, Misra says, â€œAny area which gets a better supply and has more unmetered supply, shows more losses.â€� To supply more power to particular areas like Hathras, which falls under the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and Saharanpur, was a government decision in which he could do nothing,he said .

Figures reveal that Saharanpur district receives 2,673.59 million units (MU) of power while Lucknow district receives 3,186.61 MU. Agra zone receives 5,054.86 MU, from which Hathras and other nearby towns get their supply.

Admitting the fact there had been few raids in Hathras and Saharanpur, energy minister Ramveer Upadhyay said â€œAs the area falls under TTZ, 24-hour supply was maintained. Therefore, there were more line losses in these areas.â€�

2,"Interest on farm loans waived, says Rajnath","PANCHKULA: Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh said the Centre has declared waiver of interest on agriculture loans to farmers in drought affected areas for the year 2002-03.

Singh said that in spite of agriculture ministryâ€™s advice to the contrary, some state governments were unduly pressing the farmers for repayment of agriculture loans in the drought year. ""I would like to appeal to the state governments that they should give respite to the farmers,"" he said.

Speaking to the media at a press conference on the sidelines of Haryana BJP executive meeting, which concluded here on Sunday, Singh said the Centre was working at reducing the costs of agriculture inputs. ""Our vision in this area is guided by the agriculture policy 2000,"" he said.

Singh said the BJP government had given Rs 12,000 crore as drought relief to the states. ""This is the maximum amount given for drought relief by any government since Independence,"" he said.

He said that apart from this the Centre has also extended contingency relief in form of foodgrains.

He said the Centre is committed to extend all help to Haryana after the state suffered its worst drought last year. "" We have given whatever has been demanded and will do so in future as well.""

Singh said the Haryana BJP executive has pressed him for extending crop insurance scheme in the state and state advisory price to the cane farmers.

On the Prime Ministerâ€™s recent visit to China, he said that Vajpayee has proved his diplomatic skills to the whole world.

Singh deflected question on the Mayawati government but said in a lighter vein that the government was simply running.

He said the BJP will follow its own agenda as and when the party is able to get majority on its own.

The conference also brought to the fore the difference in opinion on the BJPâ€™s support to the Chautala government in Haryana. Whereas Rajnath Singh said there were no differences between the two parties at the Centre and the state level, former Haryana BJP president Ratan Lal Kataraia said the state unit of the party was highly dissatisfied by its treatment by the Chautala government.

3,BSP to fight next polls in 3 states,"LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Mayawati said on Sunday that her party would contest vidhan sabha elections in all the three states going to polls by the end of this year. Her party would only keep off from the poll in Mizoram, she added.

Addressing the meeting of the party workers at the Dr Ambedkar Maidan, the chief minister said that she was confident of performing well at the poll and make a serious bid to capture power at the Centre. She said unless we captured power at the Centre the plight of the poor would not improve. Taking a dig at the Centre, Mayawati said that the state often ran short of funds and it was the responsibility of the Union government to provide adequate money to Uttar Pradesh. She said that she had made several requests to the Centre to provide funds but her efforts could not succeed. This attitude of the Centre was causing harm to the state. Mayawati said that at times she did not receive the due cooperation from the Centre. The chief minister said that it was the responsibility of the Centre to give funds to remove unemployment but she was not getting support for this purpose. She also criticised the Samajwadi party.

On the need to guard the party from vested interests, the chief minister said that the power-hungry should be not only kept at bay but thrown out of the party. She said there was need to identify such people. Such people could pose danger to the party, she said.

About the new members joining the party, the chief minister said that first they should be educated about the party discipline and the ideology and only then they should be entrusted with serious responsibility.

4,"Mayoral polls: Uncertain, but lobbying on","BELGAUM: Uncertainty hangs over Belgaum civic body elections. The mayoral polls are to be held before 12 noon on Monday. But the last minute writ petition filed by Dalit Sangharsh Samiti (DSS) and a few SC/ST corporators demanding the mayorâ€™s post be reserved for SC/ST,

will be decided by the High Court on the same day.

Sources reveal that the state may act on the show-cause notice issued to the Belgaum City Corporation (BCC) regarding its superceding might also give a dramatic twist to the Mondayâ€™s mayoral elections.

Though the conduct of polls is uncertain, hectic lobbying is on for the top posts, behind the screens. Just like any previous BCC mayoral elections, the names of candidates who are in the fray have not yet been revealed either by the ruling party or by the opposition.

According to sources, former mayor Sambhaji Patil and the present deputy mayor Sunil Kudachi, brother of Belgaum MLA Ramesh Kudachi, are vying for the post from the ruling party. Sambhaji Patil, known as ''mayor maker'' is a very strong person to compete with. The previous two lady mayors were from his group. Besides, he carries the label of Marathi speaking person, since language is an influencing factor, if not the deciding factor in the elections.

The other faction of the ruling party, Sarvabhashika Samavichar Vedike, belonging to advocate N B Nirwani and other six Kannada speaking corporators, is not very happy with the two previous mayors from the Marathi Speaking group. They feel this time the mayor''s post should go to a Kannada- speaking person. That might decide favourably for Sunil Kudachi.

The MES-Shiv Sena alliance, have also not yet revealed their candidate''s name. This group led by MLA Manhohar Kadolkar, have no strong contenders up their sleeve for the race.

Another opposition group, an off-shoot of MES and Shiv Sena, mainly from the Marathi speaking section, have recently formed a group called Marathi Swabhiman Group, which will either support or oppose Marathi and non-Marathi candidates.

Ex-mayor Shivaji Sunthkar from the opposition group is still nurturing the desire to come back as mayor. The last mayoral elections had taken a dramatic turn in the last minute as four MLAs and one MPs voted in favour of MLA Ramesh Kudachi''s candidate Neelima Chavan making her win against Shivaji Sunthkar, who was a hot favourite. The issue may turn the tables for some this year.

For the deputy mayor''s post, which is reserved for woman candidate from SC/ST community, has two contenders in former deputy mayor Veena Kolkar and in Reema Pawar, a Marathi speaking corporator.

In all, the 58 ward Belgaum City Corporation has 40 Marathi speaking corporators and 18 Urdu and Kannada speaking group. The race for the posts of mayor and deputy mayor is surely going to be decided by city MLA Ramesh Kudachi and former mayor Sambhaji Patil, according to the political pundits in Belgaum.

6,Brand Gujarat still rules strong on bourses,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has a strong brand equity. The name sells and there are many companies which encash this potent value. The Bombay Stock Exchange, for example, has 68 companies where the name begins with ''Gujarat'' and another nine where ''Gujarat'' forms part of the name.

That is a lot considering the fact that Punjab comes a distant second with 15 companies on the BSE, followed by Andhra Pradesh with seven and Maharashtra with six.

The BSE-Sensex and the NSE-Nifty each have a company which incorporates Gujarat in its name while no other state figures in the list. The BSE-200 and NSE-200 have six companies with Gujarat name, with two from Punjab and Tamil Nadu respectively.

Well-known listed public sector units encashing on the Gujarat brand are Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals, Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers, Gujarat Alkalies & Chemicals, Gujarat Mineral Development Corp and Gujarat Industries Power Co.

Private sector majors are Gujarat Ambuja Cement, Gujarat Gas, Gujarat Heavy Chemicals and Gujarat Flurochemicals too are in this bandwagon.

Anagram Securities vicepresident Vinod Sharma says that one of the major cause for this was the primary market boom between 1989 and 1995. ""Even a company named ''Gujarat Garbage'' would get lapped up in the market, but a name like ''Orissa Diamonds'' would fail. ""This was a common joke amongst brokers in those days"", he says.

Sources say Gujarat Industrial and Investment Corp (GIIC) and Gujarat State Financial Corp (GSFC) encouraged entrepreneurs to fund their projects partly through loans and partly through public issues which so many companies from the state tapped the capital market.

Mudra Communication''s vice-president (creative) Jagdish Acharya says that the word Gujarat is associated with a business-friendly environment, safety and prohibition.

""While Mumbai or Hyderabad have a strong brand value, Maharashtra or Andhra Pradesh do not carry much weight. As most companies using the word Gujarat are into industrial product selling, the name helped them while dealing with institutional buyers in other states,"" explained Acharya.

Sunil Parekh, former head of CII-Gujarat, pointed out that the use of Gujarat in the name improved the company''s credibility as it was associated with an industrially advanced state.

""Institutions like the GIIC and GSFC, involved in promoting investments in the state, also encouraged the use of the brand (Gujarat) for companies with which they were involved,"" he added.

A senior official at GIIC confirmed this. ""Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals was the first major success story for the state. Thereafter, GIIC encouraged new companies formed with its help to use the Gujarat brand. This helped in promoting the state as well giving greater credibility to the company across India,"" he said.

Some of GIIC''s success stories are Gujarat Ambuja Cement, Gujarat Gas, Gujarat Heavy Chemicals, Gujarat Alkalies and Gujarat Flurochemicals.

Gujarat Gas managing director Shantha Raju said the company was originally promoted by GIIC as Gujarat Amino Chem Ltd and then Mafatlal''s were invited to pick up an equity stake and the company was renamed as Gujarat Gas Co Ltd. When British Gas acquired majority stake, the name was retained.

""Gujarat Gas had a good brand image and hence there was no rationale in changing the name,"" he said.

8,"'Tiger', 'lioness' to ensure fair polls","HAJIPUR: Vaishali district magistrate Rashid Ahmed Khan has mooted a unique, ""cost-effective"" way to ensure fair and peaceful council polls for the Vaishali local bodies quota which is scheduled to be held on July 10. He plans to erect huge cut-outs of Vaishali superintendent of police Shobha Ohatker at all 16 polling booths in the district.

A lathi-wielding Ohatker will keep the evils at bay and ensure free and fair polls, the DM believes.

While talking to mediapersons here recently, Khan said in a lighter vein, ""The Vaishali DM and the Vaishali SP have the nicknames, tiger and lioness respectively, in the administrative circles, so miscreants will not dare come near the booths to tamper with the ballots papers.""

Patting himself in the back, the DM said that he, as well as the Vaishali SP, have stood the test of time and proved their mettle. ""People have been warned not to indulge in any malpractices on July 10 as Ohatker would be on prowl with a big, strong stick,"" he said.

""The Vaishali SP''s presence at each and every booth is not necessary for free and fair polls. Her life-size cutouts will be enough to keep the miscreants at bay,"" Khan jokingly said.

When RJD leader Awadhesh K Singh suggested the DM that video cameras should be installed at each polling booth, the DM asked him to arrange money for this purpose.

At least Rs 16,000 will be required for it and there is no provision for taking financial assistance from outside sources, he added.

Ohatker, however, desisted from Khan''s idea, saying: ""Police forces will do patrolling in and around the polling booths.â€� â€œThe idea to erect my cut-outs at each polling booth would make me a laughing stock,"" she added.

10,Muggles make merry at magical Potter party,"KOLKATA: From children to their parents to almost everyone and everything â€˜muggleâ€™, the euphoria of J.K. Rowlingâ€™s Harry Potter continued to rage on Sunday.

The employees of Standard Chartered Bank at Rash Behari branch joined the craze by hosting a Potter Party as the concluding programme of the customer week on Sunday. The party comes just after a week of publication of the fifth book in the series Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix.

Packed with around 100 muggle children, all existing and potential customers), the party began with the â€˜sortingâ€™ ceremony.

Unlike Hogwarts, the hat could not screech but was a huge hit with the participants, aged between seven and 14 years.

For Sushmit Mustafi, a class VI student of M.P. Birla Foundation, the sorting ceremony was the best show because he was assigned the Gryffindor house. Having read four editions of the series and completed 200 pages of the fifth, Mustafi was excited about attending his first Potter party.

â€œIt is very interesting with the theme-games revolving around incidents in the book,â€� he said. There was also a real life Harry Potter. Dressed in a black suit and a broomstick, Ayan Ray was Potter at his best.

â€œThe kids are clicking photographs with me and some of them are expecting me to fly on the broomstick,â€� said the excited bank employee.

The Potter party was part of the bankâ€™s 150th anniversary celebrations. â€œThe brainwave was one of our colleagueâ€™s. We hadnâ€™t a clue who Harry was until last week, but we got it going,â€� said branch manager Soumi Gupta.

11,CPM to confront protest against power bill,"KOLKATA: CPM state secretary Anil Biswas on Sunday warned â€˜stern government actionâ€™ against the SUCI backed agitation in front of CESE and SEB offices in protest against increased electricity bills.

â€œWe canâ€™t tolerate vandalism at cash collection centres and forcible prevention of consumers who are willing to pay their bills there. Such movements are against the interests of the people. The state government will take stern action against the agitators,â€™â€™ he said.

Claiming that the CPM was also fighting in the interest of the consumers, he held the Centreâ€™s new electricity Act as a source of woe for common electricity users.

â€œThe CESC has also increased the power tariff on the basis of the Central act. We have been fighting against it and all forces should join hand on this issue,â€™â€™ he said.

However, SUCI state secretary Pravash Ghosh blasted Biswas and charged him with speaking in a forked tongueâ€™. â€œThe CPM is opposed to the Centreâ€™s electricity Act but passed the same kind of Bill in the state assembly,â€™â€™ he said.

Meanwhile, reiterating the Left Frontâ€™s resolve not to form panchayat boards with the help of the Congress, Trinamul and BJP, Biswas said such boards would be dissolved if it had been formed in any districts by lower level CPM cadres.

Biswas also refused to make it clear whether the government would bring a bill aimed at consolidation of agricultural land, different from the Bill discussed in the state cabinet early this week. â€œLet the Bill be introduced and we will discuss the matter at the political level,â€™â€™ he said.

The cabinet has approved an amendment to the land reforms Act replacing the word â€˜holdingâ€™ by â€˜plotâ€™ in the context of redefining â€˜consolidation of land.â€™ This was done in view of high courtâ€™s order to clarify ownership pattern of land, claimed finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

13,Citizens in suburb protest water 'tax',"KOLKATA: After resentment in the city against the imposition of water tax, it was the turn of the residents in the northern suburbs to protest the move. On Sunday, about 500 citizens of Khardah held a convention to voice their opposition to what they called was the municipalityâ€™s laying of water tax through the back door.

The convention was organised mostly by dissident CPM activists. Speakers included former MLA Sadhan Chakraborty and a present councillor, Saibal Gupta.

According to the organisers, from the current fiscal, the Khardah Municipality has imposed a â€˜service chargeâ€™ of varying degrees for domestic water supply.

â€œIn the lowest slab, this makes the water charges even more than the property tax. A person paying an annual tax of Rs 100 pays Rs 180 for water supply. This is nothing but penalising the poor,â€� said Gupta.

14,"Corner govt, CLP chief tells Dwcra women","HYDERABAD: Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Y S R a -jasekhara Reddy has asked Dwcra groups to corner the government during the forthcoming â€˜Mahila-Rythuâ€™ Janmabhoomi for failing to fulfil the promises made during the previous grama sabhas.

The CLP leader, in a statement issued here on Sunday, asked the Dwcra groups to demand the government to release the revolving fund to all self-help groups, who had completed six months, pay salaries to anganwadi workers and also put pressure on the Centre to reduce the price of cooking gas.

Reddy accused chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu of making false promises to women only to gain votes. Stating that Naidu had transformed the state into a â€˜Madhyam Andhra Pradeshâ€™ with the indiscriminate issue of licences to liquor shops, the CLP leader asked Naidu to waive tax on gas cylinders. He ridiculed the chief minister for promising cell phones to Dwcra women, while the latter were demanding marketing facilities for their products.

Reddy demanded that the government refrain from collecting 15 per cent interest on loans to Dwcra groups, while the groups were only being paid three per cent interest on their deposits.

The CLP leader recalled that Naidu had not fulfiled any of the promises made to women prior to the 1999 elections that include four lakh house-sites, 40,000 ration shops, revolving fund to Dwcra groups, 1.5 lakh old-age pensions, girl child scheme, free education for girls and banks.

15,NGOs point out lacunae in domestic violence Bill,"PUNE: City-based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have pointed out several lacunae in the draft protection from domestic violence Bill 2002, which was placed before the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha last year and will come up for discussion next month.

The NGOs expressed their views at a seminar, â€˜Towards elimination of domestic violenceâ€™, organised by Susamvad, a womenâ€™s organisation, on Saturday. The Bill provides harassed women with an opportunity to approach a â€˜protection officerâ€™, who will guide them to file an application before the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC). As per the Billâ€™s provisions, the JMFC can issue a prohibitory order to persons ill-treating women.

If there is breach of this order, an offence can be registered, which could result in a yearâ€™s jail term and fine for the accused. Principal judge of the family court, Pune, Madan Joshi, told TNN that the Bill was â€œsofter than the provisions of IPC section 498 (A) (harassment of women) and tougher than civil remedies, such as divorce. â€œThe Bill, if passed, will act like the Sword of Damocles on people committing atrocities against women,â€� he said.

Susamvad chairperson, Prasanna Invally, felt that the effectiveness of the Bill would be reduced if it could not establish the reasons for domestic violence. â€œOnly when the reasons for the violence are clearly established, can protection be provided,â€� Invally said. The Bill should provide equal rights to women in the house, she added. Invally was apprehensive about the capacity of the government in providing a financial outlay for implementation of the Bill.

â€œWithout a substantial provision in the budget, effective implementation of the Bill is not possible,â€� she said. Former public prosecutor Milind Sahasrabudhe, who has been helping womenâ€™s organisations in the city, said it was extremely important that the prohibitory order issued by the JMFC must state that the aggrieved woman had the right to stay in her husbandâ€™s house without fear of violence. â€œThis condition is very important for the Bill to be successful,â€� he said.

18,Cong stages protests to seek probe on Taj,"AGRA: Congress party workers staged a token protest on Monday by blocking the railway line at the Raja Ki Mandi station in the heart of the city.

They were demanding a judicial inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge into the illegal construction of heritage corridors along the Yamuna River bank in the vicinity of Taj Mahal.

Earlier, the Congress held a black flag demonstration on the banks of Yamuna behind the Taj Mahal and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his alleged complicity in the illegal construction of controversial heritage corridor.

The Congress demonstrators jumped over the railway fencing and stopped the Taj Express, a special tourist train, and climbed its engine raising slogans.

Police present there persuaded the demonstrators to clear the track, and the train continued its journey after a delay of five minutes.

Addressing a gathering at the station, city Congress President Ram Tandon said his party was not against the heritage corridor provided it was cleared technically and the Central government and UP government maintained transparency in the implementation of the project.

He said the Taj was a heritage of universal importance and must be protected for posterity.

In a separate incident, Samajwadi Yuvajana Sabha city President Riazuddin has started a dharna on the site of the heritage corridor. His party has also organised a community kitchen for all the workers who have been rendered jobless after construction work by the National Project Construction Corporation (NPCC) was stopped following directives from the Union tourism and culture ministry.

21,Small pubs rue liquor policy,"NEW DELHI: Stand-alone pubs and restaurants serving imported liquor say they will be squeezed out of business in the wake of major 5-Star hotel chains across the city planning to halve prices of imported spirit served at their F&B outlets.

The culprit: a recent notification by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) that allows hotels to import liquor duty free against 5 per cent of their duty free earnings.

In a desperate attempt to survive, the restaurant and bar owners have now approached the centre seeking a reversal of the order or a level playing field. ""We have already met commerce minister Arun Jaitley once and another meeting is scheduled this week. Let''s hope something comes out of it,"" says a National Restaurant Association of India representative.

Both not everyone is as hopeful. ""We are threatened of being wiped out. We have been running from pillar to post for the past few weeks and still nothing has come of it,"" says Ritu Dalmia, owner of the Diva restaurant in the capital. ""When we sought a level playing field from the DGFT, they referred us to the tourism ministry for a certification. We are just meeting various government officials without any solution in sight.""

So, what''s hurting the industry? Come September, most of the F&B outlets across all 5-Star hotels are planning to overhaul the prices on their beverages menu.
