0,Badal giving political hue to criminal case: Lal Singh,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab finance minister Lal Singh has urged former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to come clean on whether he has faith in the court of law.

In a statement issued here on Monday, Lal Singh has alleged that Badal has been trying to give political colour to a purely criminal case.

He said that Badal''s desperate bid to raise popular tempers in the state only show that either he does not believe in the court of law or he knows that he is guilty and will soon be caught.

â€˜â€˜Evidently, Badal is trying to take shelter behind the sentiments of innocent people of Punjab,'''' alleged Lal Singh.

Badal and his family plan to run the party from jail, as they fear that even a slight slackening of control over the party will make shun the tainted leaders, said Lal Singh.

He advised the Akali Dal to desist from spreading rumours about the Congress and rather put its own house in order.

He scotched all rumours about replacement of Amarinder Singh with somebody else. He said most of the leaders whose names were being floated as contenders to the post of CM, have themselves denied any such move.

In fact, the entire Punjab Congress legislature party is solidly behind the leadership of Amarinder Singh, he added.

1,EC comes down on MP govt over power subsidy,"NEW DELHI: In what could be a major embarrassment for the Madhya Pradesh government, the Election Commission has decided that the state governmentâ€™s decision to suspend the Electricity Act, 2003, and subsidise power supply to farmers is a violation of the model code of conduct.

The ECâ€™s view would be placed before the Madhya Pradesh High Court on Tuesday. The HC had asked a petitioner, who had challenged the governmentâ€™s decision, to move a representation before the EC to find out if the state cabinetâ€™s decision was a violation of model code.

Though EC officials do not want to say anything on record, the decision was taken on November 6 after all the parties were heard. EC officials said since the subsidy was to come into force from November 5, it amounted to a clear violation of model code of conduct, since by then, polls had already been announced.

It was on September 24 that the MP cabinet announced its decision to give free power with retrospective effect from January 2002 to farmers with five horse power motors.

On October 8, it suspended the Electricity Act. The decision came the same day as the subsidy issue was challenged in the HC.

As per provisions (section 65) of the Electricity Act, the government has to deposit the subsidy amount, to be fixed by State Electricity Regulatory Commission, in advance. But the Cabinet decided that the payment would be made after December 31, 2003. Later, the Act itself was suspended.

2,Interest of West in Punjab will lead to political autonomy?,"JALANDHAR: The fact that two British Columbia premiers and the Canadian PM came all the way to Punjab with impressive delegations has forced the political and economic scholars to interpret the purpose of these visits, which was not merely vote bank politics, keeping in mind the large presence of Punjabis there, but also a search for markets.

An interesting consequence in this entire exercise, which they foresee, is political autonomy to the state. This political autonomy might become a ""compulsion"" in the globalised world.

The resistance put up by the Centre in the form of instructions to the Punjab chief minister to keep himself away from any formal welcome functions is being seen as a reaction to the trend with Punjab and British Columbia directly establishing relations.

""The same is likely to happen in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and other states that are enterprising enough. Punjabis, who had little opportunity here, went out and prospered by their determination and hard work. They have convinced their state heads to visit Punjab and other states to sign MoUs. It''s the beginning of a new chapter in international relations. Political maps of various countries may have to be re-drawn,'''' said Dr Pramod Kumar, director, Institute for Development and Communications.

""The tour of Punjab''s police officers to England was necessitated by the peculiar problems faced by the police there while handling cases concerning Punjabis,"" he added.

""By investing here, they would get an access to the world''s biggest middle class to sell their products,"" he added. Economics Prof Sucha Singh Gill of Punjabi University said, ""The healthy growth rate, the Fifth Pay Commission salary hike, a high per capita income and large presence of Punjabis in Canada has forced the Canadian government to look towards Punjab for markets. They see Punjabis as major consumers. Ludhiana has the largest number of cars per capita. Those who had scooters earlier now have cars. Mobiles have become a necessity...""

The movement towards Punjab started with the visit of former BC premier Ujjal Dosanjh. Then came a delegation led by the BCâ€™s then highway and transport minister Harry Lally, who had emotional links with Doaba and had brought with him a business proposal.

3,One crushed to death in train suicide pact,"MYSORE: A middle-aged woman died and another seriously injured when they came under the wheels of Shatabdi Express near Srirangapatna on Monday. The condition of the injured is stated to be critical.

Mysore railway police said the duo had entered into a suicide pact and sat on the tracks on a bridge when the train was speeding towards Mysore around 12.50 p.m.

Though the alert driver saw the duo and slowed down the train, he could not save Jyoti (30), a native of Chandagala in Srirangapatna taluk, while the other, Sharada of Nagenahalli, was seriously injured.

The train stopped after covering some distance when passengers rescued Sharada and rushed her to Mysore, where she was admitted to the K.R. Hospital. Railway police said the duo had left a suicide note saying they were taking this step on their own. They befriended each other while working in a private mill in Mysore.

4,Unified policy to benefit cellular users,"AHMEDABAD: The new unified licensing policy in the cellular industry may have pitted giants in the industry against each other, but the consumer, once again, seems to be the king with the new regulation providing a bouquet of advantages â€” more players in the market leading to more competition that would translate into better services and not having to split hair over choosing technology.

However, with things still in a nascent state and tariff packages yet to be formulated as per the new laws, both service providers and consumers are trying to figure out the advantages that the policy may have brought for them.

While Gujarat Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited chief general manager Pradeep Kumar says it is too early to comment on the impact on the market, a recent report by CRISIL indicates that greater clarity should emerge on the business prospects of the various players.

The report says the competitive scenario would intensify further as the number of fully-mobile service operators would increase from four to six in Gujarat and many other circles.

Smaller players would be more sensitive to competitive pressures as their subscriber growth would be further stunted.

Larger players, on the other hand, should find it easier to fund their business plans as lenders are expected to take a positive view on the regulatory clarity.

The benefits of reaching a much larger subscriber base through full mobility services and without any major incremental investments in infrastructure clearly outweigh the costs that either Reliance or the Tatas would have to pay.

â€œIt would be interesting as customers would have a wider option in technology. Since all service providers, irrespective of the technology, would offer everything, customers would only have to assess the quality of service.

The unified licensing regime would thus intensity the competition in the wireless telephony business,â€� says Jagrut Vyas of Tata Teleservices.

â€œPlayers will especially compete for roaming customers, who offer a higher average revenue per user (ARPU) than other customers.

So far, these customers were largely cornered by GSM operators because of their ability to provide seamless mobility, service which would no longer be only restricted to them,â€� adds Vyas.

CRISIL opines that the unified licence regulation offers the most level playing field to GSM and WiLLCDMA operators.

Says Infrastructure Ratings director Anil Kumar: â€œThe unified licence option seems to have offered the solution to the long-winded controversy on limited mobility.â€� However, the CRISIL analysis warns that while competition could lead to lower roaming charges, will mean lower roaming revenues for GSM operators.

Since roaming revenues account for around 10 per cent of their gross revenues it may not affect their topline significantly but their operating margins could come under pressure due to lower roaming revenues and higher selling and marketing costs for acquiring and retaining subscribers in an increasingly competitive scenario.

Experts say the key issue now is whether GSM operators would take recourse to litigation to protest against full mobility to WiLLCDMA operators.

5,TN journalist arrests: Scribes express solidarity,"LUCKNOW: The action of the Speaker of the Tamil Nadu assembly ordering arrest of five journalists of the English daily The Hindu and the DMK mouthpiece Murasoli drew flak from the politicians and the journalists from all over the state.

Protests march were taken out and sit-ins were staged by the journalists to condemn the Speaker''s order.

The journalists, who also boycotted the press galleries of both the houses of the state legislature for an hour on the first day of the budget session on Monday, assembled at the Vidhan Sabha and marched to the GPO Park under the aegis of UP Press Accredited Correspondents Committee.

The assault on the freedom of press also echoed in the state assembly where leader of opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Lalji Tandon and leader of the Congress Legislature Party Pramod Tiwari termed the Tamil Nadu assembly Speaker''s ruling as an attempt to muffle the voice of the fourth pillar of democracy.

Terming the action as a ''dangerous trend'', the journalists at a meeting held later asked the press fraternity to remain united in order to defeat such ''attacks on the freedom of expression''.

The speakers, including the president of the Indian Federation of Working Journalists Union, K Vikram Rao, member of the Press Council of India, Shitla Singh, representative of The Hindu, JP Shukla and several senior journalists strongly condemned the Tamil Nadu assembly ruling.

6,Mallika seeks modification in bail condition,"AHMEDABAD: Danseuse Mallika Sarabhai on Monday pleaded for modifications in the conditions of her anticipatory bail, allowing her to travel outside Gujarat.

Her plea was heard by the sessions court in the alleged immigration racket case. The plea will be heard on Tuesday.

Sarabhaiâ€™s counsel RK Shah submitted that as the danseuse was â€œa trustee and office-bearer of 21 organisations she is required to go for meetings and cultural activitiesâ€� around the country and therefore, be allowed to travel out of the state.

He also said there was no question of Sarabhai absconding and that she would be liable to damages if she did not attend the programmes scheduled for November 12, 13 and 20, November 23-28 and December 24.

The court asked Shah to present supporting evidence on Tuesday to substantiate the necessity of her presence at the programmes scheduled for November 12, 13 in Mumbai and deferred further order till then.

Additional sessions judge PB Desai, while granting anticipatory bail to Sarabhai earlier on October 29, had imposed the condition that she would have to seek prior permission of the court, before leaving Gujarat. Meanwhile, an order in the bail plea of the co-accused in the alleged racket, Dhimant Upadhyay, is likely to be passed on Tuesday.

7,Ara readies for farm labour meet,"PATNA: Ara town is getting spruced up for the two-day national conference of the Akhil Bharatiya Khet Mazdoor Sabha, beginning November 14. As many as 1,500 delegates drawn from all over the country would participate in the conference, according to reports reaching here from Ara.

While party general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya would be the chief guest on the occasion and will also address the â€œektaâ€� rally of agricultural labourers and peasants, organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Khet Mazdoor Sabha (ABKMS), on November 14, the delegates would be from 18 states, Union territories and sub-regional zones.

The ABKMS delegates, representing 15 lakh members all over the country, would be from such states and Union territories as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Kerala, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Uttaranchal, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Pondicherry as well as Karbi-North Hills.

According to the ABKMS, the conference, being held at a crucial juncture, has gained special significance, as the organised and unorganised labourers are being subjected to curtailment of their democratic rights.

It said that the national conference would give a new orientation to the struggle of peasants and agricultural labourers, since the country had been subjected to â€œdomination of big capital and growing imperialist interventionâ€� in its agriculture. Accordingly, the ABKMS would fight to ensure dismantling of MNC-WTO-World Bank regime and reversal of the governmentâ€™s policy of corporatisation of agriculture for self-reliance and adequate food security.

Besides, in Bihar itself, the Laloo-Rabri regime had cemented unholy alliance comprising politicians, mafia, bureaucracy and police resulting in havoc in the countryside, which has been further vitiated by joining of hands between the RJD and Ranvir Sena, the ABKMS insisted.

In keeping with the mood, Ara was being bedecked with red buntings, arches and party flags, while a huge publicity drive has been launched with the help of vehicles and â€œpadyatrasâ€�. In the countryside of Bhojpur, 50 arches have been erected and posters are also being pasted on a large scale. Memorials to cadres killed during the struggle have also been made.

9,HC asks Bihar govt to revive sick PSUs,"PATNA: The Patna High Court on Monday directed the state government to find out ways to revive its sick and closed public sector undertakings (PSUs) if it is feasible because their closure is no solution to the problem.

Hearing a PIL, a division bench of the high court comprising Chief Justice (CJ) Ravi S Dhavan and Justice S K Singh earlier took chief secretary K A H Subramanian to task for the government inaction with regard to payment of outstanding salary and retirement dues to the employees of state PSUs despite the fact that Rs 50 crore has been lying with the high court for the purpose.

The bench was irked when it was told on behalf of the state government that since the case relating to non-payment of salary and retirement dues to the employees of state PSUs is still pending with the Supreme Court, the case filed here should be kept adjourned till the matter is disposed of by the apex court.

â€œWhat should the high court do when such employees file complaints (writs) that they are unable to get themselves or their family members treated properly due to non-payment of their dues by the state government? Should we tear up such writs and allow them to die? About 1,300 such employees are reported to have died so far,â€� observed the CJ.

When government counsel R K Dutta informed the bench that the state government has initiated a move to wind up some of its companies, the CJ said, â€œBut you have not taken a policy decision and are not submitting relevant documents for the same. If you have headache, you apply some ointment or take some pills; you donâ€™t think of severing the head from the body.â€�

The hearing remained incomplete on Monday.

10,Congress duo to discuss election tie-ups with Sonia,"HYDERABAD: Amidst signs that the Congress rank and file favour a pre-poll alliance with like-minded parties to defeat the TDP-BJP combine, APCC president D Srinivas and CLP leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy will be in New Delhi on Tuesday, ostensibly for a lengthy strategy session with the high command.

The two leaders returned to the city on Monday evening after suspending the Congress bus yatra in Krishna district and addressed separate press conferences to assert that the yatra would resume â€” possibly in less than a week â€” after their return from Delhi. Rajasekhara Reddy said the state Congress had an open mind to a pre-poll understanding with other parties, while Srinivas maintained that electoral â€˜tie-upsâ€™ are at the top of the list of topics he will discuss with Sonia Gandhi.

According to informed sources, the two leaders are likely to discuss the possibility of the party having an alliance with the CPI, which has in the past expressed its willingness for such a tie-up. The meeting will also examine the impact of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) in Telangana. The Congress Forum for Telangana (CFT), an intra-party group, wants the high command to join hands with the TRS, while the CPM has made it clear that it will not have any understanding with the Congress.

Rajasekhara Reddy and Srinivas tried to make light of the ultimatum given by the CFT and maintained that the high command would take a decision on its demand for a separate PCC for Telangana. While Rajasekhara Reddy said the CFT leaders were a confused lot on the issue, Srinivas pointed out that he disfavoured CFTâ€™s use of the word â€˜ultimatumâ€™ to the high command.

In New Delhi, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni told The Times of India: â€œHe (Naidu) will lose, whether he goes for polls in March or September next year (as scheduled). If he thinks that he can cash in on the sympathy factor generated by the assassination bid at Tirumala, he is mistaken.â€™â€™

According to Rajendranagar assistant commissioner of police A Soloman C Wesley, a student Syed Abdul Wahed, 18, was on his way to the college on a bike when he was knocked down by a jeep a few metres away from the college. Other students of his college rushed him to the Shadan Hospital on the campus where he was declared dead by the doctors, Wesley said.

However, students alleged that Wahed could have been saved had the doctors attended to him immediately. According to the students, the doctors refused to admit Wahed and only after being pressurised, they took a look at him and suggested he be taken to the Osmania General Hospital. By then it was too late to save him, the students said.

When the students held a dharna, college owner Vizarat Rasool Khanâ€™s sons arrived with security guards and started beating up the students. Four students were confined to a room. Vizaratâ€™s sons opened four rounds of fire into the air to disperse the students. â€œWe have registered cases and identified the seven accused who hit the students,â€™â€™ Wesley said.

17,BKS asks farmers to pay electricity bills at old rates,"AHMEDABAD: The state unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has directed the farmers to pay electricity bills as per the old tariff and asked them to protest any move by the Gujarat Electricity Board for recovery of dues as per the new tariff.

The BKS general secretary, Maganbhai Patel, on Tuesday said the farmersâ€™ organisation has not yet reached to any settlement with the state government over the increased charges of electricity for the farm sector and therefore, there is no question of paying the bills as per the new charges as demanded by the GEB.

Patel said the farmers should resist any move by the GEB for recovery of dues as per the new rates and should not hesitate to launch peaceful agitation against such harassment by the board.

The mass protest programme should be finalised in consultation with the gram and taluka samitis of the BKS. The BKS leader also warned the GEB to stay away from any confrontation with the farmers on this issue, or else they would have to face consequences.

Recently, a group of farmers at Nandasan in Mehsana district had attacked the GEB staff as they entered the village for recovery of arrears of electricity bills from the farmers.

Patel said a meeting of the sangh will be convened this week-end to take stock of the situation and chalk out future course of action to continue their protest against the hefty increase in power tariff for the farm sector, as farmers were not happy with the relief announced by the state government.
