0,Dalits clash with BJP men,"AHMEDABAD: Members of the Dalit community---many having Congress leanings---clashed with the BJP leaders during Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations at Sarangpur here on Wednesday.

Some senior BJP leaders reportedly sustained minor injuries in stone-pelting. Though no police complaint has been filed, around 50 members of Ambedkar Karvan were arrested, taken to Kalupur police station and detained there. Congress candidate Rajkumar Gupta, who is pitted against BJPâ€™s Harin Pathak for the Ahmedabad Lok Sabha seat, intervened and got them released.

Protesters said the root of the clash can be traced back to RSS chief KC Sudarshanâ€™s alleged derogatory comments on Babasaheb Ambedkar. Ambedkar Karvan chief Ratnaben Vora, who is a Congress corporator of Rakhiyal, had distributed more than 50,000 pamphlets in the city cautioning BJP leaders against attending the Ambedkar Jayanti function.

However, BJP workers and some senior leaders turned up at the function. After Dalit leaders and some Congressmen finished garlanding the statue of Ambedkar, all hell broke loose when BJP corporator Amit Shah stood up to pay homage. Loud anti-BJP slogans rang out in the Sarangpur square demanding that saffron brigade backtrack immediately. Some boisterous Dalit youth also pelted stones prompting policemen present in large numbers to lathicharge the mob.

1,Trinamul leader evades arrest,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress leader Sanjay Bakshi has finally reaped the benefits of being a politician. The police could not arrest him 24 hours after the youth leader assaulted a traffic constable.

Senior police officers said they could not trace Bakshi. The Trinamul leader, however, dared the cops to arrest him maintaining the charges against him were false and motivated.

He said he would do election works and campaign throughout the day. This despite an FIR being lodged against him at the Girish Park police station on Tuesday.

On Wednesday morning a fresh brawl broke out after some supporters of Bakshi held a road blockade outside the Girish Park police station at 11.10 am. Bakshi, however, was not present at the agitation programme. After about fifteen minutes, police decided to remove the blockade. When they tried to do it, there was a commotion. One of Bakshiâ€™s supporters was arrested for fomenting trouble.

The cops alleged soft-pedalling on the matter has come up for some criticism. The Trinamul leader had allegedly assaulted a 50-year old traffic constable Partha Banerjee who stopped Bakshiâ€™s vehicles for violating traffic signal on the Central avenue-Girish Park crossing, on Tuesday afternoon. He was charged with assaulting an on-duty policeman.

Bakshi has steadfastly refuted the charges and alleged that the traffic constable had ill-treated him. However, the Trinamul leaders too have kept quite on the issue. Knowing well that this kind of incident, gives people only a poor opinion about the party, the Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee refused to comment on the incident. Other Trinamul leaders to chose to remain silent on the issue.

2,NRIs and polls: A quaint equation,"HYDERABAD: Elections were in the air then. Many English-speaking, jeans-clad, flashy middle aged people were doing the rounds of political party offices.

They werenâ€™t selling PR solutions to politicians, but testing the election waters. They were NRIs on scouting trips, trying to figure out whether they should pitch their cases to contest the polls.

Of them, only two got tickets. Madhu Y Goud is a Congress nominee from the Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat and B Murali Krishna is contesting for the Bahujan Samaj Party from the Himayatnagar Assembly seat.

In fact, that Nizamabad would have an NRI contestant wasnâ€™t unexpected. The last elections had seen an NRI, Atma Charan Reddy, win Nizamabad on a Congress ticket.

But why would an educated, successful person in the US or in UK want to return to the state and plunge into the rough and tumble of electoral politics?

â€œAs I see it, there could be three reasons,â€� says Lok Satta national convener Jayaprakash Narayan. â€œThey may be out to seek recognition from their people for their accomplishments. They could be genuinely interested in making a difference to their people or they want power and leverage this for their investment capabilities.â€�

But what does the wannabe neta NRI has to say? â€œIâ€™ve come to develop my city. To show that NRIs like me are capable of contributing more than anyone else for its development,â€� asserts Murali Krishna. Now for Krishnaâ€™s track record. He was born in Tenali, Guntur. He did his BTech from Bits Pilani, MTech from IIT, Chennai and MBA from IIM Bangalore.

He now runs a consultancy firm in Virginia, USA. Today, heâ€™s walking the squalid lanes of Himayatnagar seeking votes. Sounds strange? Probably. For, if development is all they seek why not invest in a business venture? Why join politics? TRS Lok Sabha candidate from Hanamkonda, B Vinod Kumar, has an answer. Politics and development, he believes are parallel activities. They go hand in hand.

But can an NRI contest election? Kumar, who was once convener of TRSâ€™s human resources development panel, says: â€œYes, as long as the NRI carries an Indian passport, he can.â€�

The question now is how welcome is this NRI welcome in the party as a poll nominee? For, in each party, there are hundres waiting to grab a ticket. â€œNo party will be foolish to accommodate an NRI if he isnâ€™t approved and supported by the party cadre,â€� Jayaprakash Narayan said.

A BJP leader seconds this. â€œConsidering there are very few seats, there is no way we will give a ticket to an NRI without satisfying our long-faithful cadre first.â€�

Even if they are given tickets, do they make the final cut? â€œWe donâ€™t have to bear the cross of a negative image unlike most politicians. That gives us a start thatâ€™s good enough to win votes,â€� Krishna said.

â€œThey stand a good chance. They may not know everything about politics, but then who does? At least these NRIs are better educated,â€� Narayan said.

3,Futures scope: FIIs signal rally,"MUMBAI: Derivatives players are scenting another market rally. With open interest positions taken by FIIs in Nifty futures contracts dipping substantially over the past two weeks to near December levels, dealers believe this is evidence of underlying positive sentiment.

In just 12 trading sessions between March 26 and April 13, FIIs have reduced their exposure in the Nifty April futures contracts by more than 55% to 12,769 contracts from 28,601 contracts. This is close to the early-December levels of around 11,500-12,000 contracts.

In value terms, too, the average FII open interest in Nifty futures has dropped substantially from almost Rs 1,000 crore in March to around Rs 570 crore now.

Derivatives strategists keep a keen watch on the FII positions in Nifty futures since these entities hedge their equity portfolio regularly using Nifty futures contracts.

When FIIs feel that the broader market is likely to see a dip, they sell Nifty futures against their equity portfolio to hedge their positions. On the contrary, when they feel that the market is expected to go up, they reduce their hedging activities substantially by lowering their exposure to Nifty futures contracts.

Derivatives strategists pointed out that in the past, a dip in the open positions held by FIIs has most often been followed by a sharp upturn in the market. The reverse is also true, as witnessed during late February and early March.

The Sensex and the Nifty witnessed their biggest monthly gain in recent times in December. Resolve of derivatives traders has been boosted by the fact that FIIs have been reducing open interest in Nifty futures since early April, a report from IDBI Capital Market Services pointed out.

â€˜â€˜With FII positions at December levels, we are expecting another big rally from current levels,â€™â€™ said a derivatives strategist. However, the elections could play spoilsport, dealers said.

Technically, too, the Nifty could again hit the 2,000 level over the next few weeks.

4,Volunteers on their mark to contain violence,"HYDERABAD: About 1,100 Old City volunteers are ready to contain any violence in their areas, communal or election-related.

Election campaign is on in full swing in the older parts of town and the atmosphere is charged.

â€œOur volunteers are on day-and-night vigils in all sensitive areas, particularly now that election campaign is on and at points where there are massive gatherings,â€� Peopleâ€™s Union for Civic Action and Rights (Pucaar) co-ordinator and Confederation of Voluntary Association (Cova) womenâ€™s wing convener Nurjahan Siddique said.

While some volunteers mingle with the crowds, some others are scattered in other sensitive areas too, so that once any problem is sensed, the other volunteers are alerted, she said.

Slumlevel conveners and those in the mandal hold regular meetings to discuss peopleâ€™s problems to prevent untoward incidents in these area.

â€œPeople are also made aware of their rights to vote and choose the correct person who can serve people, based on their work in the last five years and not on party propaganda only, â€œ Nurjahan said.

Through the voter awareness campaigns, open fora and election watch programmes, people are made aware of the contestants, their background and performance, she said.

Volunteers affiliated to various organisations in the Old City, including Cova and Pucaar have also chalked out a list of demands based on problems of Old City residents and submitted to the political parties for their election manifestos.

5,Booth politics captures Jehanabad attention,"JEHANABAD: The Election Commissionâ€™s decision to shift polling booths in villages from community halls to schools might be an innocuous decision but in this volatile constituency, it has created large sociological divide. The ECâ€™s decision has led to sharp polarization which may trigger large scale violence on the polling day.

In fact, this could be the pattern in most of the 11 parliamentary constituencies going to polls in the first phase on April 20. The reason behind such an apprehension is that almost all community halls are located in the dalit bastis whereas most schools are in the upper caste areas of the village. While dalits fear they would be stopped again from casting their votes, upper caste people are preparing themselves to meet the resistance.

There is a widespread resentment against the ECâ€™s move in all the constituencies. In Taku Block, the booth has been shifted from Gareriabigha, dominated by dalits, to 12, Lower School which is situated amidst upper caste households.In Sakurabad police station area the poll station has been moved to Ranvir Sena held Hasanpura village from Dharampura.

A similar change has been brought about in Arwal block where the booth has been moved to Devibigha, again an upper caste stronghold.

â€˜â€˜The shifting of polling booths is described as a brazen decision inspired by parties like the BJP and JD (U),â€™â€™ alleges Mahanand Prasad of Arwal.

But the lower castes voters, who have tasted the power of ballot are not willing to give up the fight for their rights so easily. They are willing to put up a brave front, if the need arises.

8,Nagra for President’s rule in Haryana,"PANCHKULA: Lambasting the ruling Indian National Lok Dal for not maintaining law and order, Haryana Vikas Party candidate from Ambala parliamentary constituency Aman Kumar Nagra, on Wednesday, demanded Presidentâ€™s rule be imposed in the state to ensure free and fair elections.

Addressing a press conference after attending public meeting at Barwala, Nagra claimed that only the HVP has played the role of opposition in the state properly. The BJP has been a party to INLDâ€™s wrongdoing for four years while Congress remained a mute spectator to the partyâ€™s misdeeds, alleged the HVP candidate.

â€˜â€˜We would make a clean sweep in the state as the electorate has accepted HVP chief Bansi Lal as their leader and most suitable person to head the state,"" said Nagra. Claiming to retain more than 1.5 lakh votes polled in his favour as BSP candidate, Nagra stressed that the HVPâ€™s popularity among the masses would help him to win the seat.

Terming Congress as a party of opportunists, Nagra, while referring to his decision of joining the HVP, said that â€˜vested interestsâ€™ of some regional Congressmen forced him to leave the party. â€˜â€˜Scared of losing their status, they betrayed me and my supporters by denying a party ticket,"" Nagra said.

Meanwhile, the district unit of the BJP suffered a jolt when Naresh Sharma, a block samiti member, along with 200 supporters from Barwala and Raipurrani joined the HVP during the election meeting at Barwala.
