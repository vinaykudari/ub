0,Telgi case suspect arrested,"MUMBAI: Kishore Dhingra, who is wanted in the Rs 2,200-crore stamp paper racket, was arrested in Ulhasnagar by the Special Investigation Team. The team also arrested his associate, Suresh Chandwani, officials stated.

Police officials said Dhingra was a close friend of assistant police inspector Dilip Kamath, who was recently arrested in the case. He had previously travelled to Goa with Kamath and met Abdul Telgi, the prime accused in the stamp paper racket.

Dhingra is also wanted by the anti-corruption bureau for questioning in connection with a raid on Hotel Juhu Residency on June 9. He was used as a ''punter'', or bait, by the social service branch of the Mumbai police to trap six aspiring models in a prostitution case at the hotel.

Dhingra was routinely used as a witness in several raids at hotels and bars in Mumbai, officials said. The anti-corruption bureau now wants him in custody because it wants to establish the authenticity of the raid. Two officers, senior inspector Shanker Mahadik and inspector Narendra Singh, were arrested a few days after the raid for allegedly demanding bribes.

1,Mumbai varsity to review law exam results,"MUMBAI: Mumbai University''s law department has decided to ""look into"" the problem of the high number of failures in the final year LL.B results. The pass percentages for the 2003 LL.B batch stand abysmally low at 32.43 for the five-year course and 24.5 for the three- year course.

Students and teachers had expressed surprise not only at the poor pass percentage but also at the fact that the list of failures included names of students who had done well in the previous years.

""Since the students are worried we will look into the results,"" law department dean Nilima Chandiramani said. The university, she said, was concerned about students'' welfare and would definitely look into their grievances.

The pass percentage for the five year course has drastically dropped from 62.2 in 2002 to 32.43 this year. Students, who had done well in previous years, have failed in three to four papers. Several of them have had to put on hold job offers and admissions to foreign colleges.

2,Mamata mulls Bangla bandh,"KOLKATA: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is contemplating a Bangla bandh unless the state government gave up what she described as attempts to create a ""tax raj"" in the state.

She also announced that her party would launch a prolonged movement against the state governmentâ€™s attempt to frame a code of conduct for the councillors in the Trinamul-BJP-run Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

Hours after the state government placed a bill in the Assembly trying to amend the KMC Act, Mamata said on Friday that the Trinamul would organise a state-wide demonstration for two hours from 10 am on August 1 to protest against state governmentâ€™s imposition of tax on almost all walks of life.

""This government is imposing fresh taxes almost daily. Power tariff, hospital charges and education fees had been hiked earlier. How will the common people survive,"" an angry Mamata asked.

""And how can the state government frame a code of conduct for the councillors. If any such code is to be prepared at all, it should be done by the KMC itself and not by the state government,"" she said.

Mamata said Trinamul supporters would hold demonstrations on the streets all over the state even if this led to blockade of roads.

""It will be a prolonged movement and will continue till all such taxes and the black bill is withdrawn. We are keeping all options open including calling a Bangla bandh,"" she said.

3,CGHS shock for govt employees,"PUNE: Nearly 1.5 lakh central government employees and 40,000 pensioners in the city are in for a rude shock on the issue of medical benefits. They were previously entitled to numerous facilities, ranging from consultation to heart surgery at the prestigious CGHS-recognised private hospitals. Now, however, they are being denied these facilities and are, instead, being referred to the state government-run Sassoon general hospital.

CGHS (Pune) joint director A Prabhakar has issued an â€œadministrative circularâ€�, asking all CGHSrecognised private hospitals not to accept non-emergency cases.

Prabhakar refused to give reasons for the directive, and said CGHS beneficiaries could approach any government hospital for consultation on an OPD basis.

Patients could, however, continue to go to private recognised hospitals for medical procedures or surgeries, he said.

Contradicting this assurance were government employees, who said they were being referred to Sassoon general hospital, and not private hospitals.

The new directive has thus resulted in considerable confusion. It is apparently a fallout of a surprise inspection last week by two senior officials from the CGHS headquarters in New Delhi, who reportedly found a number of private hospitals furnishing exorbitant bills to the government for the treatment of CGHS patients.

July 19: Delhi team conducts surprise checks at 4 hospitals). The team, comprising additional director general (headquarters), K. Khosla, and deputy director general, Urmila Mahajan, checked documents related to treatment and billing of patients under CGHS and noted that private hospitals in the city were doing unnecessary surgical procedures.

Senior CGHS officials said the high-level team was in the city to verify the claims made by city hospitals on the CGHS grant to pensioners.

Prabhakar, in his circular, has also noted that â€œhospitals are admitting CGHS beneficiaries in non-emergency conditionsâ€�, and warned that bills will not be settled if hospitals are found to be ignoring the circular.

This decision has infuriated central government employees, who, till recently, were entitled to medical facilities at 49 private hospitals and 18 diagnostic centres, besides the seven CGHS clinics in the city.

After a meeting on Thursday, the confederation of central government employees and workers, decided to write to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and Union health minister Sushma Swaraj, and also send 1 lakh postcards to them, expressing their anguish.

Confederation general secretary Harish Radhakrishnan said the new measure will deprive both serving and retired government employees of medical benefits.

â€œAs it is, the Sassoon hospital is overburdened,â€� he said, pointing to an instance where a beneficiary was asked to wait for 14 days for a thyroid check-up.

â€œThis decision is in gross violation of the notification issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in September last year, which allowed treatment to CGHS beneficiaries at recognised hospitals and diagnostic centres, even for non-emergency cases,â€� said Radhakrishnan.

â€œThese â€˜SOSâ€™ messages are an attempt to apprise them (PM and health minister) of the problem here,â€� he said, pointing out that the last option was to move the central administrative tribunal.

Confederation president K A Sayyad said CGHS beneficiaries were also being refused treatment for emergency cases.

He said although private hospitals and diagnostic centres were supposed to charge the actuals, if lower than the approved rates, they were charging the approved rates. Another official said the yearly allocation of grants was exhausted in less than three months.

The government guidelines clearly mention that private hospitals/diagnostic centres, whose rates for a procedure/test/facility are lower than the approved rates, shall charge the actuals.

M G Joshi, secretary of the defence-civilians pensioners association, said the beneficiaries had not been informed about the decision.

4,Will two-children norm in UP make government smile?,"LUCKNOW: The deputy PM''s hint about a possibility of a two-children policy to be made into a law to arrest the spiralling population graph, made during his recent visit to Gorakhpur, literally sounded like music to experts and officials in UP.

With the head count crossing 170 million mark, population stabilisation in the state seems a distant dream. Adding to the sense of panic is the realisation that if the current fertility trends continue, the population will be 216 million in 2011 and by 2051 it will reach a whopping 441 million.

Last two decades specially have seen a plethora of government sponsored programmes and schemes for population stabilisation. Each has however, proved to be jinxed, going by the high failure rate. And one of the most glaring fiascoes has been the UP government''s ''Green card'' scheme launched with much fanfare in 1985.

Implemented on July 5, 1985 it offered the moon to those opting for sterilisation after two children. All they were required to do was to show ''green card'' issued after the procedure and enjoy a host of benefits under various schemes floated by the department of rural development. It also promised free education to their children up to intermediate in government or government aided institutes, free medical facilities in government hospitals, priority in house allotment under the government housing scheme, housing loans or licences for PDS shops.

The scheme, predictably was a major hit specially among government employees and did give a short-time boost to the sterilisation programme, but the benefits remained confined to the GO.

It took the state government seventeen long years to realise this. On July 16 2002, chief secretary DS Bagga issued yet another GO that categorically mentioned that the earlier order had failed in its objective and also linked this directly with the unacceptability of small families in the state.

The ''green cards'' failed to make their appearance. Health officials contacted by TNN on Friday failed to provide figures, if any, of green cards actually issued in UP under the scheme. One of the reasons for the total fiasco was the absence of a monitoring or supervisory system. Experts feel that a law could be the only hope here.

5,AIPWA protests women's quota Bill delay,"PATNA: Hundreds of women under the banner of the state unit of the All India Progressive Women''s Association (AIPWA) demonstrated here on Friday for the passage of the women''s reservation Bill in the current session of Parliament.

Led by state unit president Saroj Chaube, secretary Shashi Yadav and vice-president Bharti S Kumar, the AIPWA activists shouted slogans like ""aam sahmati ka natak band karo"", ""mahila arakshan vidheyak parit karo"" and ""sansad mein purushwadi sanshray ko dhwast karo"".

Holding the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government responsible for not getting the Bill passed, they also raised slogan, ""BJP murdabad"".

Later on a delegation led by Chaube met governor M Rama Jois and gave him a memorandum addressed to the President.

The procession, which was stopped at the Hartali Chowk, turned into a public meeting, which was addressed among others by Bihar Mahila Samaj secretary Ratna Sinha and Sunaina Devi.

They said that on the one hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party has brought the Bill keeping in view the coming elections, while on the other it wanted to escape on the plea that no consensus could be reached inside the Parliament.

The Parliament, which had earlier passed anti-people Act like Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) and other finance bills at a joint session of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha despite a boycott by the opposition members, is not allowing women members even to speak.

""The manner in which the women''s reservation Bill has been tabled 8 times and the treatment meted out to it, goes to show that the House is dominated by men"", said Chaube.

They said that no formulae of the Election Commission of India is acceptable to them and it is the duty of the RJD government of Bihar to get the women''s Bill passed by Parliament.

Chaube said that marches were organised in other states and before Parliament on Friday to press for the passage of the Bill.

7,Nawada lawyer electrocuted,"NAWADA: A district court lawyer, Virendra Kumar, was electrocuted when a live electric wire fell on him near Udyog Bhawan building of New Area locality here on Friday morning.

The police said that a large number of people, including some lawyers, gathered on the spot where the advocate was electrocuted and did not allow the police to take away the body demanding action to be initiated against the officials of the electricity department responsible for the tragic incident.

Nawada Bar Association president Vijay Kumar Sinha demanded adquate compensation to the victimâ€™s family. The residents of the locality allowed the body to be taken away for autopsy only after the administration promised to look into their demands.

8,Students protest expulsion over ragging,"PUNE: Angry protests by student organisations began at the ILS Law College on Saturday morning against the college decision to revoke the expulsion of 26 students who were allegedly found to be indulging in ragging.

Student organisations of various political parties staged demonstrations at the college campus protesting against the revocation of the expulsion order. The protests were continuing amid police presence at the time of filing this report. A delegation also met college Principal Vaijayanti Joshi urging her not to re-admit the expelled students.

Many from the 26 expelled students, one of who is son of additional advocate general, Gujarat, Kamal Trivedi, celebrated with joy on Friday after they learnt that their expulsion had been revoked.

The 26 students were expelled by the college authorities on Saturday last after college principal Vaijayanti Joshi declared that they were found guilty of ragging.

The students, however, protested against this decision saying that no serious incidents of ragging had happened and that the college authorities ""have over-reacted.""

On Thursday, barely five days after their expulsion ILS Law Society president and former Supreme Court chief justice Y V Chandrachud directed the college to withdraw the decision.

According to ILS Board Member Satyaranjan Sathe, Chandrachud was not happy that the ""principles of natural justice"" were not followed while taking the decision. The college has thus been advised to issue a show-cause notice to the concerned students and institute a fresh inquiry into the incident.

9,<span class=text><font color=blue><b>NAGALAND: CROSSROADS OF CONFLICT</b></font></span><br>Games the chief minister plays,"KOHIMA: Badminton and politics are compatible bedfellows. Both involve deftness in passing the buck, reacting to actions on the other side of the court and nimble reflexes to score points.

Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphio Rio plays both -- ""baddy"" and politics -- and also uses the game as a part of the Rio management technique to keep his flock together. After all a good pow-wow on his swank Yonex badminton court at his residence -- and the ""boys"" complete with shrieks, grunts and backslapping -- keeps Rio and his men on the same side of the political court. For larger battles ahead.

July 23 was no different. A day after the union government turned down, his cabinets recommendation to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in the state by virtue of now extending the Disturbed Area Act beyond July 22, Rio looked more concerned about finishing three games and winning them.

The cast on court included one MLA who had just defected from the Congress, the Director General of Police, the transport commissioner and the finance minister. The CM and his partner the MLA won two games, the finance minister put up a good show, the aging DGP matched his political boss point to point, each dressed swankily in their Nike and Adidas sneakers and Yonex rackets.

Other stuff could wait. ""My chief secretary has conveyed my governments disappointment to the Centre. I shall meet the Deputy Prime Minister soon. But right now, we have to look ahead,"" Rio says, adding that since the government allowed the ban on the NSCN(IM) to lapse, he felt that it was natural to remove the Disturbed Area tag as a sop to the underground forces to pave the way for future peace.

Asked about his perceived ""softness"" towards the NSCN(IM), Rio doesn''t hedge the issue. ""They are not a banned organisation anymore and they have a base and they are capable of taking the process forward. We have to give them a chance."" While agreeing that other factions and groups should be roped in before any decision is taken, Rio agreed that the NSC(IM) was ""capable and able"" of taking the lead.

While this is a measure of honesty, his critics point out that he is a one-faction chief minister, a charge that Rio dismisses. ""I am just being realistic since the government of India is also talking to the NSC(IM).

Notwithstanding, the centres decision to continue with the Disturbed Area status for Nagaland, Rios move to repeal it, the first chief minister to do so, has evoked support from key Human Rights organisations like the Nagaland Peoples Movement for Human Rights (NPMHR). Its Secretary Neingulo Krome said: ""With a friendly government in power in Nagaland, there is hope for a serious solution.""

People in Nagaland have traditionally given their emotions a bigger pride of place than fact. And Rio scores high on the feel good barometer, unlike his predecessor S C Jamir, who was seen as the Centre''s man. And that''s half the battle won. His coalition called the DAN (Democratic Alliance of Nagaland) now has 45 MLAs in a 60-member house with the CMS own party the NPF having 30 members.

Clearly, badminton has taught Rio the art of wining friends, points and numbers. Nagaland hopes that he can add lasting peace to his kitty.

11,Karnataka ministers warn Togadia on his speeches,"BANGALORE: Two senior Karnataka ministers on Saturday sternly warned VHP international secretary Praveen Togadia against making any provocative statements while addressing a public rally in Bijapur on Sunday.

The Karnataka High Court on Friday stayed an order passed by the Bijapur District Commissioner banning Togadiaâ€™s entry into the district. The DC had passed the order on the grounds that Togadia''s speech was likely to disturb peace in the communally sensitive city.

``We are given to understand that the court has also laid down certain conditions to be followed by Togadia. We hope that he will abide by them. In case, Togadia makes any provocative statement, law will take its own course,â€� law and parliamentary affairs minister D B Chandre Gowda told reporters here.

Meanwhile, home minister Mallikarjuna Kharge too warned Togadia against making any inflammatory speech. ``Togadia has to watch out what he speaks. If found that he is violating the court order, we will initiate legal action against him,'' he added.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president B Janardhana Poojary has urged the state government to put Togadia behind the bars if he ``overstepped'' his limits.

``Persons like Togadia are detrimental to secular fabric of the nation. The state government should arrest him even if he utters a single word that can create communal unrest in Bijapur,'' he said at a party function here.

12,Sonia flays govt's health policy,"NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Saturday hit out at the Government for ""very slow"" progress in the health insurance cover to the people. She said this was one of the conditions on which her party had extended support for the liberalisation of the insurance industry.

""The coverage of health insurance must expand significantly â€“ indeed this was one of the conditions on which I had extended the support of the Congress party to the liberalisation of the insurance industry four years ago. But unfortunately progress has been very slow"", she said.

Gandhi was speaking at a convention of elected representatives on the role of the Political Leadership in combating HIV/AIDS, organised by Parliamentary Forum on HIV/AIDS.

Stating that over one-fourth of spending on health in the country was by individuals, Gandhi said in other countries, the proportion of public investment in health was significantly higher. ""We must move in this direction quickly.""

Expressing a ""few special concerns"", Gandhi said that the country could not overlook or accord any less importance to the risk of HIV/AIDS through drug use. This was of particular significance in the North-East which was somehow not getting adequate focus, she said.

Gandhi said it was ""paradoxical"" that while Indian companies were world leaders in the manufacture of anti-AIDS drugs and were supplying such drugs to many other countries, India did not have drug therapy as part of her AIDS control programme.

""We are the only major country to have this dubious distinction. Should we not be making a beginning?â€� she asked.

Stating that doubts had been expressed both in the country and abroad on the number of those infected, Gandhi said, ""We must carry greater conviction and credibility so as to counter some of the doomsday scenarios that get painted from time to time on HIV/AIDS in India.""

Though the infection rate might have reached epidemic levels in a few states, there were large, populous states where the spread of HIV/AIDS was fortunately limited, she said adding these states would require special attention since many of them were poor and lack physical and social infrastructure.

She said AIDS education for adolescent girls, both school going and those out of school, was essential.

""BSNL will like to inform that such data has never been supplied in the past nor is there any intention to do so in future as a matter of routine. It is further clarified that ministry of finance has agreed to relax during 2002-03 the condition for filing of return in those cases where people were owning two telephones,"" a BSNL statement said here.

BSNL said that finance ministry''s move had made it easy for the people to acquire as many telephones as needed.

The BSNL move followed after some newspapers reported that the revenue department was pressuring BSNL to disclose its customer data to enable Income-Tax department to widen the tax net.

""Our customers are assured that BSNL''s commercial policy is not making known the bills of their customers to any outside agency,"" it added.

Chairman Prithipal Singh had earlier in the week denied any tussle with the revenue department over the disclosure of customer data.

""We do not do such a thing on a routine basis. For special cases when such data is required by any of the investigative agencies, there are prescribed legal procedure that all service providers have to comply with,"" Singh had said.

14,Sharif slams army indulgence in Pak politics,"ISLAMABAD: Condemning the military''s indulgence in politics, deposed Pakistani Premier Nawaz Sharif has said that the Generals cannot define the future of democracy, which is the responsibility of democractic forces.

""We wish to see our military as purely a professional institution and condemn its indulgence in politics, which is maligning the institution. Military must restrict itself to the role of defending the geographical frontiers of Paksitan,"" Sharif said in a message read out at the All Parties meet convened by his Pakistan Muslim League (N) party here.

Accusing the military of turning Pakistan into a ""garrison"" with the law of gun and power as supreme law of the land, he said the people of Pakistan had been pushed into a trap of severe poverty and unemployment by the anti-growth and anti-poor economic policies of the present government.

The former premier pointed that other countries are busy transforming their economies into knowledge based economies and restructuring their societies to develop world class competitiveness while we are still stuck in 16th century debates and dealing with Cromwellian characters.

While the economic miracle has touched the lives of millions in East Asia and South Asian countries are catching up fast with the new global trends, we unfortunately moving in the reverse direction, he said.

As democrats and concerned Pakistanis, we can''t allow ourselves to be spectators under this situation. ""The Generals can''t define the future of democracy, it is the responsibility of democratic forces,"" he said.

15,KPCC challenges VHP on Hindutva policy,"BANGALORE: Attacking Sangh Parivar''s hard line Hindutva policy, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president B. Janardhana Poojary challenged the VHP on Saturday to set right the ''aberrations'' prevalent in Hindu caste system.

""All that the VHP and its allied organisations are adept at is -- minority bashing... Let them first stop discrimination of Dalits. Propagating Hinduism without dismantling caste hierarchy is meaningless,"" he said addressing the centennial birth anniversary of late Swami Ramanandtheertha, former president of the then Hyderabad Pradesh Congress Committee, here.

Recalling the recent attack on Dalits, allegedly by VHP activists, for slaughtering cattle, Poojary said the incident proved that the Hindutva propagators were ''casteist''.

""For the VHP, cattle is holy and important than Dalits. Otherwise, how else will they defend the attack on Dalits for cow-slaughtering?"" he asked and suggested the VHP activists to introspect themselves. He called upon the Congress partyworkers to defeat the ''evil'' designs of the VHP and to protect the secular fabric of the nation. ""VHP was nowhere during Indian freedom struggle. Today, they are dictating terms to others. The onus on us, therefore, is to overcome them,"" he added.

Referring to BJP members stalling the Assembly proceedings on Friday, protesting the ban on VHP international secretary Pravin Togadia''s entry into Bijapur district, Poojary questioned the credentials of JD(S).

""None of the JD(S) leaders, who claim to be secular, condemned BJP leaders'' attitude,"" he said. He urged the state government to name the proposed veterinary sciences university in Bidar after Swami Ramanandtheertha.

The Congress, too, staged a walk-out later saying they had not been allotted enough time to speak on West Bengal Panchayat Elections Bill, 2003,that was passed during the day.

18,LU students protest police lathicharge,"LUCKNOW: Over a dozen people were injured, including two teachers and six PAC constables, and over two dozen vehicles damaged when hundreds of students of Lucknow University went on the rampage on Saturday evening.

They were protesting against the police lathicharge on a studentsâ€™ procession at Hazratganj, earlier in the day.

The procession was being led by Samajwadi Party student leader and former LU studentsâ€™ union president Abhishek Singh Ashu. The students were proceeding towards Rajbhawan when they were stopped by the police near Hazratganj intersection.

Among their demands were the roll back of the fee hike, announcement of students union elections and the dismissal of the LU proctor.

There was more confusion as the studentsâ€™ procession coincided with separate agitations by some traders and Congress workers. Sources said the police asked the students to retreat. When they refused, they were taken to a police station. When some of the students tried to escape, the police resorted to lathicharge.

Twenty five students were arrested. Later in the evening, hundreds of LU hostlers assembled outside Gate No. 1 and started pelting stones at the new law building, where over 200 candidates and their guardians had come for counselling for under-graduate courses.

Lucknow University vice-chancellor S B Singh described the violent incidents as â€˜â€˜politically motivatedâ€™â€™.

Addressing mediapersons, Singh said the university administration would not tolerate any act of indiscipline, adding that all the students responsible for the incident would be expelled.

Singh said he had asked the district administration to provide adequate security cover to teachers and students on the campus. LU Teachers Association President (LUTA) president RS Yadav expressed shock over the incident and said the teachers would be forced to take â€˜â€˜direct actionâ€™â€™ if the district administration failed to arrest all those guilty of

violence.

19,Bihar governor for ban on bandhs,"PATNA: Governor M Rama Jois stressed on the need to follow the ancient doctrine of Trivarga, a balance between dharma, artha and kama, which will help in securing welfare and happiness for all.

Inaugurating a two-day seminar on â€œThreats to civil societyâ€� organised by the Sauvvuex Foundation in collaboration with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Foundation, Jois said that unfortunately the present generation gives greater importance to economic prosperity and fulfilment of economic desire.

Jios said that the desire to make more and more money has become predominant, as a result, instead of establishing a need-based society a greed-based society has come into existence.

â€œThus the age-old and time-tested doctrine of Trivarga got replaced by the doctrine of Dwiwarga, namely money and immoral desire, because of which the entire nation is facing a appalling situation,â€� he said adding, â€œthe serious threat to civil society is due to the replacement of the doctrine of Trivarga.â€�

Jois said that the intrusion in the life of common masses by the so-called protectors of fundamental rights during bandhs is another problem and it should be stopped immediately. It is common knowledge that bandhs at times causes irreparable injuries and hardship to millions of citizens. It is high time that the Supreme Court ban on bandhs should be imposed in totality, he added.

He further said that the number of persons indulging in civil and criminal misdeeds have increased to such an extent that it cannot be controlled or prevented by the police, CBI or the judiciary. The need of the hour is an active and selfless participation of all right thinking people and organisations, including political parties, labour unions and studentsâ€™ unions, to end the menace, he maintained.
