0,"Before Navratri, govt sings divestment tune","GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: In an obvious bid to generate a ""feel good factor"" on the eve of the Vibrant Gujarat show, the Gujarat government on Wednesday announced its intention to kick-start - what it called - an ambitious programme of restructuring/ privatising state public sector companies.

The announcement, which came after the weekly Cabinet meeting, however, did not set any time-frame for the divestment process. Neither did it identify the companies.

However, it said that a Cabinet subcommittee, headed by the CM, was being constituted for the purpose and also an ""independent experts'' committee"" was being set up to decide the details.

Gujarat has 55 state-owned companies and analysts said that when divestment does take place, Gujarat State Fertilisers and Chemicals, Gujarat Narmada Valley Corporation, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation and Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals could be prime candidates for privatisation.

Given the past experience in other states and also the Centre, analysts however felt that it would be at least a year or more before anything concrete happens.

Interestingly, the programme announced on Wednesday is also with a view to strengthen the strained finances of the state government and its high debt.

A recent Reserve Bank of India bulletin says that the total debt of the Gujarat government as on March 2003-end was Rs 46,689 crore, up from Rs 38,102 crore in the previous year.

Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are the only states whose debts are higher.

An official statement from the state government said: ""The state finance department would set up a separate fund for debt repayment. The fund would include money made available to the state government after disinvestment and restructuring of the PSUs.""

The disinvestment process â€” which had been mooted earlier â€” came to a standstill in 1999 when Keshubhai Patel was in power.

Though a Cabinet subcommittee under the chairmanship of state finance minister Vajubhai Vala for disinvestment was formed soon after Narendra Modi returned to power in December 2002, it has not met yet.

To give more credibility to Wednesday''s announcement, the official press note said that Modi had discussed the matter with Union minister for disinvestment Arun Shourie recently and the latter had ""a word of praise"" for the state government''s ""module.""

Vajubhai Vala told TNN that the process of setting up the two disinvestment groups for giving expert and technical advise would be formed after the Navratri.

""We have no time for that now,"" he emphasised.

Significantly, the official note says that any PSU disinvestment would be ""approved"" by the Gujarat Assembly which would now meet for its budget session in February 2004.

""Full transparency would be ensured in the matter,"" the note said.

1,"Ace powerlifter seeks government support, sponsors","LUDHIANA: The sorrowful expression on her face tells it all when you ask her about her future plans. Reluctantly, she replies that all depends on the availability of monetary resources.

Mandeep Kaur of Khalsa College for Women, Ludhiana, whose feat of bagging three silver medals in the World Junior Powerlifting Meet, recently held at Poland, went largely unnoticed by the national media. She emerged as the first Indian in the history of powerlifting sport to achieve such a distinction in an international event.

Her plight can be gauged from the fact that a few days before the prestigious event, she had no money to meet the expenses of going abroad. The college authorities stepped in at the right time after all her efforts to arrange money from various sources, including the district administration, failed.

This gutsy girl hailing from Gill Patti village, near Bathinda, has proved her mettle. â€˜â€˜I was guided by an overwhelming feeling of doing my country proud. I cannot forget the moment when the Indian tricolour went up during the prize distribution,'''' says Mandeep, who had earlier won a bronze medal at the World Junior Powerlifting Meet held in Bulgaria in 2001.

Daughter of a retired bank employee, she took to this sport out sheer fascination. Her career got boost when she took admission Khalsa College for Women. â€˜â€˜We provide her free education, hostel facility and a special daily diet,'''' says principal Varinder Kaur Thind.

But will a daily diet of Rs 50 enable her to realise her dream to bag a gold medal for the country at an international competition? Though highly appreciative of the support from her college, who will support her after she leaves college is what is worrying her.

With no private sponsorship coming her way, government support is what Mandeep is desperately hoping for. Though this sport yet to gain recognition at the national and international level, this should not be taken as an excuse deny her official patronage, says her coach Gurinder Singh, who runs a private gymnasium in the city. He points that the Punjab sports department has already included the sport in its gradation list even as other states have provided government jobs to powerlifters.

A winner of 60 gold medals at different national level competitions so far, Mandeep has one more year to compete in the junior category internationally. â€˜â€˜It is a pity that she has not been officially felicitated far, what to speak of any help,'''' rues her coach.

3,Students protest fee structure,"NEW DELHI: More than 200 students enrolled in the masters of computer application (MCA) programme at Noidaâ€™s JSS academy of technical education have been on strike since last Friday protesting the extra fees being charged by the college.

Students say there are gross discrepancies between the fee structure prescribed by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and what the institute is charging. The council had issued a public notice regulating fee structures for AICTE approved institutions.

â€˜â€˜We tried reasoning with authorities but they refused to pay any attention. We had no option but to resort to striking, but the college is threating to suspend our representatives,â€™â€™ said one student.

JSS Acedemy, the institue at the centre of the controversy, is formed by a Mysore based trust and is affiliated to Uttar Pradesh Technical University. According to students, while some other colleges like Meerut institute of engineering and technology (MIET), affiliated to the same board, have refunded the amount, JSS Academy has not made any such move. Students are also raising questions on the amount being charged as â€˜â€˜otherâ€™â€™ fee by the college. As per AICTE guidelines, fee structure for all technical institutions is to have two components, â€˜development feeâ€™ and â€˜tution feeâ€™ which includes â€˜otherâ€™ fees as well.

The Noida institute, is however charging an additional Rs 10,000 from both paid and free seat students under a separate catagory of â€˜other feesâ€™. Students claim they have the AICTEâ€™s support .

â€˜â€˜We have been in touch with the AICTE since July and our last interaction with them was on Tuesday. The councilâ€™s legal advisor has issued a letter to the institute, and action is to be taken if the college doesnâ€™t offer a clarification within 15 days,â€™â€™ said second year MCA student. College authorities say their fee structure has been in accordance with the UP Techincal Universityâ€™s guidelines.

â€˜â€˜Our representative is currently in Lucknow to discuss the issue with the principal secretary for higher education. The college is affiliated to UP technical university and we will adopt their fee structure. If the board tell us to follow the AICTE norms, fees will be refunded,â€™â€™ said head of administration, M L Gupta.

4,Panchkula youth commits suicide,"PANCHKULA: Twenty-sevenyear-old Lalit Chaudhary committed suicide under mysterious circumstances at his Sector 10 residence here on Thursday morning.

The incident took place soon after he returned home from a police post where he was summoned in connection with a complaint lodged against him by a local cable operator.

Lalit, who was earlier working in a private bank, was allegedly under depression after he lost his job following a road accident in December last year.

At the time of the incident, his father and one of his relatives were at home and his mother, who is a teacher, was away to her school in Mubarikpur. On Wednesday night, Lalit had heated arguments with local cable operator Rajesh Sharma alias Lucky over the subscription charges, after which Rajesh lodged a complaint against him. Though both the parties reached a compromise, he was upset after signing the compromise deed.

J S Shingari, a social worker, whose son accompanied Lalit to the police post, alleged that the cable operator might have misbehaved with him while signing the deed, and this might have forced him to take this extreme step.

After returning from the police post, Lalit had a brief chat with his father, after which he locked himself in a room. After knocking many a time, when his father didnâ€™t get any response, he called up Tinku, who had accompanied him to the post.

â€œWe broke open the door and found him hanging with a rope,â€� said Tinku. Meanwhile, Sector 10 police post in-charge sub-inspector Jai Pal confirmed that Lalit was summoned to the police post, but denied any misbehaviour with him.

â€œSince both the parties had handed over a signed compromise deed to the police post clerk, we decided to stay away from the case,â€� Jai Pal added. He was, however, tight-lipped over the further course of action. District police chief Ranbir Sharma informed that the statement of Lalitâ€™s father would be examined, following which a suitable action would be taken.

5,Admission process for govt medical colleges on,"MUMBAI: The St. George''s Hospital at CST, where admissions to government medical hospitals recommenced on Thursday, resembled a fortress. A battalion of policemen guarded the two entrances to the hospital, permitting only medical aspirants and parents to pass through the barricaded gates.

While admissions to private medical colleges continue to be on hold, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) started the admission process for government colleges from scratch.

The top 1600 rank holders on the state Centralised Entrance Test (CET) merit list were called on Thursday to take admission to their preferred course and college. There were no student activists shouting slogans this time round. The admission process continued peacefully till late in the night on Thursday.

According to DMER officials, students, who were absent or had boycotted the process earlier were given a chance to take admission. Of the total 3705 MBBS seats in the state, government college seats add up to 1670. Among the 1540 dental seats, government colleges have 201 seats. The annual fees for the MBBS course in a government college is Rs 18,000 while that for BDS is Rs 15,000.

Admission to private medical colleges will start only after the Supreme Court hears the petitions filed by private college managements and approves the fee structure proposed by the state government. Private colleges have agreed to reduce their annual fees from over Rs 3 lakhs to Rs 1.5 lakhs provided they be allowed to charge a premium for a given percentage of seats.

6,HC directs state govt to hold panchayat polls,"RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Thursday directed the state government and the state Election Commission to complete panchayat polls by March 31, 2004.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice P K Iyer Balasubramaniyan and Justice R K Merathia passed the order while hearing a writ petition filed by Rajender Mahto and others.

The petitioners contended that the last panchayat election in the region covered by Jharkhand was conducted in 1978 under the Bihar government. Bihar last held panchayat polls in 2002.

The state government is losing central grants to the tune of Rs 500 crore per annum for the development of villages in the state in the absence of panchayats.

The state government is violating the constitutional rights of the people of Jharkhand and the constitutional provision under Section 243 (b), the counsels appearing on behalf of the petitioners said.

They also pointed out that in 1986, the high court had directed the state government to conduct election to the Ranchi Municipal Corporation, but the election has not been held.

Rajesh Kumar, counsel for the state Election Commission, on Thursday filed an affidavit and informed the court that the commission is ready to conduct panchayat elections.

The commission had already written a letter to the state government stating therein the date for the panchayat election. But the government did not take any notice of the letter. Full cooperation of the state government is needed, Kumar added.

The court took serious note of it and said that it is the constitutional obligation of the state government to provide local self-government and it is not justified if the state government is not providing local self-government.

Anil Kumar Sinha, advocate general, contended that the delay in deciding the date for election is due to amendments being undertaken in the relevant Act with regard to dereservation of the posts of mukhiya and up-mukhiya in the areas where the tribals are not in a majority.

The court after hearing the Election Commission and the state government directed the latter to fix election dates and accordingly inform the Election Commission.

The Election Commission will recommend the election date to the governor and the governor will notify the date.

7,HC sets aside govt order on merger of service rules,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of the AP High Court, comprising justice G Bikshapathi and justice M Narayan Reddy, on Thursday set aside an order of the state government merging the services of teachers in government schools with those of local bodies.

The bench allowed a batch of writ petitions filed by mandal education officers whose services were sought to be merged with teachers in zilla parishads by an order in 1998.

The bench set aside the order of the AP Administrative Tribunal and upheld the petitioners'' plea that services of governmental and non-governmental staff cannot be merged. Counsel for the petitioners also argued that there cannot be a merger without the prior sanction from the president and, since that was not done, the entire action was illegal.

M Surender Rao''s plea that the presidential order permits creating of a new cadre and in the absence of such a cadre the question of merger does not arise also found favour with the bench.

Dealing with a batch of over 70 writ petitions, the bench made it clear that the erstwhile service rules relating to government and local body teachers would stand revived.

8,Money trouble drives couple to suicide,"HYDERABAD: A couple committed suicide by hanging at Sai Colony in Hafeezpet on Thursday afternoon.

The Moinabad police said that Shaik Mubin, 35 and his wife Asra Bee, 28, hanged themselves when the other members of their family were away from home. Inquiries by the police revealed that Mubin''s three children and his parents had gone to their relatives'' house when the incident took place.

Police said Mubin''s family migrated to the city from Sholapur in Maharashtra about 20 years ago in search of a livelihood and settled at Hafeezpet. He worked as a scooter mechanic at a shop and was trying to set up his own shop. That did''t materialse and his earnings were inadequate to take care of his large family.

Unable to shoulder the financial burden, the couple committed suicide, police said. The Serilingampally police have registered a case.

9,New rules spell trouble for call centres,"HYDERABAD: Come October 1, Indian call centres will forfeit the right to call customers at random and hard sell their wares.

A new set of rules, framed by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), make it mandatory for all outgoing calls from call centres to be routed through a Donot Call Registree.

In simple terms, it means an operator can no longer call a potential customer at random and pitch for products and services.

According to the new laws, every company must first access the Donot Call Registree before contacting customers. The catch lies here. Most Indian call centres use the outbound call model and call American citizens on behalf of their clients to market their wares.

Since the FTC will regulate all calls from Oct. 1, call centres will be permitted to access only those phone numbers provided by its clients.

""This will mean the number of outgoing calls from call centres will fall drastically,"" says a CEO of a start-up business process outsourcing centre.

Also, a call centre executive will, as a rule, have to disclose his potential customer his name, the company he works for and the firm he is representing as an agent. This long introduction will invariably end up eating into the conversation time, which will mean that the call centre executive will end up making fewer calls.

The new system would enable the customer to find out the identity of the caller and register a complaint, as and when he wishes to.

The new FTC guidelines, however, won''t hit the marketing strategies of banks, insurance companies, airlines and telecom majors.

""The new regulation might not affect many Indian companies. This is because they focus on four segments which are out of FTC''s purview,"" Flt. Lt. Bipin Chandra, vice-president (India operations) of Knoah Solutions, a leading call centre, said.

10,Cutting flab govt-style: Get cronies in,"NEW DELHI: Perhaps it is the way it works, or it''s just a matter of habit. The key attribute of the government is that what it gives with one hand it takes back with the other.

This is the spirit with which the government proposes to get rid of 10,000 low-level jobs and use the savings to promote 1,800 officers, most of whom are currently working as personal staff of ministers.

In a Cabinet note, cleared by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, the Department of Personnel and Training has suggested abolishing 10,503 posts of lower and upper division clerks in the Central Secretariat.

The note also suggests creating regular posts of under-secretaries and deputy secretaries for about 1,179 officers who were given those grades on personal considerations (in-situ promotion).

The note says the savings from the abolition of the posts would help meet the expenditure for creating regular posts of under secretaries and deputy secretaries. But even here the government proposal is niggardly. It doesn''t propose to sack the 10,000 UDCs and LDCs.

They will simply not be replaced when they retire over the next decade. But the lucky 1,800 will begin getting higher salaries and perks immediately. This is precisely the issue the PMO has raised. But it has yet to receive an adequate answer.

According to the note, the number of UDCs will be chopped from 5,377 to 538 and LDCs from 5,397 to 809.

Among the in-situ promotees, 915 section officers were given the grade of under secretary and 364 under secretaries the grade of deputy secretary.

The DOPT claims that the move has been initiated in line with the recommendations of a departmental panel on cadre restructuring. But the note admits that the recommendation has been made without studying the functional requirement of the Central Secretariat.

A panel of secretaries set up on the issue has also found other holes in the note. It pointed out that the move has the potential to adversely affect the quality of middle management in the secretariat.

Besides, the cadre recast panel â€” on which the DOPT move is based â€” did not have the mandate to recommend abolition of posts but to only study the cadre structure.

A bench of Justices S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur issued the notice after perusing the trial court order in which charges had been framed on the three key political opponents of the then chief minister Mayawati in November 2002.

Three petitioners, one of them being a complainant in one of the cases against the accused, have challenge the Mulayam Singh Yadav order on the ground that he had taken the decision without the approval of his cabinet.

Mulayam Singh had not constituted his cabinet when he ordered withdrawal of Pota charges against his close political affiliates. Accused''s counsels R K Jain and Manoj Goel accepted a notice in the court.

15,Punjab Bio-tech farm project delayed,"MOHALI: Whether the proposed Punjab Bio-Technology park planned to usher in the bio- technological revolution in the state come up in Mohali, is a matter of question. The site where the park will be set, is yet to be decided.

The Punjab government signed a memorandum of understanding with a Mohali based company, Beckons Industries Ltd to set up a Bio-technology park, with the assistance of Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST).

Initiallly, the PSCST and Beckons had indentified 50 acres of land near Sohana village to be developed as the Biotech park. This land was not acquired though, due to procedural delays. This delay may be Mohali''s loss and Patiala distict''s gain as the district administration has offered Beckons Industries a 90 acre plot for the deveploment as a boitechpark.

But the acquisition of land is not the only problem the boitechpark is facing before it becomes a reality. Beckons Industries has already identified the technoloigies, which will be utilised in the biotech park with assistance from internationally renowned companies in the field.

The managing director of the Punjab Bio-Technology Park and Beckons, Gurmeet Singh Bhatia, said that renowned biotech companies such as Ranbaxy, Morepen, Panacea biotech, Phulwari biotech and Pratishta Biotech.

But there are some areas of concern, which could seriously hamper the prestigious project and that is due to government policies.

Having announced the Bio-Technology policy for the state, the Punjab government has not provided any incentive for investors in this new field.

Bhatia said that the project could get a tremendous boost if the government were to declare a tax holiday on the lines of Himachal Pradesh, which gives 10 years tax exemption.

Bhatia said that even though the biotech policy had been framed, the government is yet to constitute a bio technology board.

Investments in the industry are another problem with almost no venture capital in sight.

Bhatia said that the government could also help out the project in this regard by transferring the unutilised venture capital fund for IT industry to biotech.

The problems before Bio-Technology park are several.

1)No venture capital for promoting biotech industries.

2)Government yet to set up boitechboard.

3)As compared to the governments in southern states which are advertising their Biotech parks in a big way by organising fairs and other activities Punjab government is not doing much.

4)Even the land allotment is yet to be finalised.

The steps government could take to promote the project are:

1)Give tax exemption to the participating companies.

2)Provide a venture capital fund to promote entrepreneurship.

19,Naidu defends tainted minister,"HYDERABAD: Notwithstanding the comments of Andhra Pradesh High Court, which wondered the continuation of P Ramasubba Reddy in the state cabinet despite facing murder charges, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday came in full defence of the housing minister saying the latter was `framed'' in the double murder case.

""The case which the court referred dates back to 1990 and the previous Congress government booked Ramasubba Reddy due to political reasons,"" Naidu told reporters at Secretariat.

The chief minister said he sees no reason to remove the housing minister from the cabinet as the court made a passing remarks about his continuation in the Cabinet. ""More so, the court''s observation is not legally binding on the government,"" he pointed out.

Naidu also said people of Jammalamudugu constituency in Kadapa district knew about the case, but elected Ramasubba Reddy to Assembly for the last two consecutive terms. The CM parried questions when reporters insisted on whether he is respecting the observations of the high court. ""That is not the issue here,"" he quipped.

A high court division bench on Wednesday remarked: ""Though there is no provision in the Representation of People''s Act or any other law, prohibiting continuance of a tainted minister in the Cabinet. Such instances raise questions with regard to working of democracy and democratic institutions.""

When asked the possibility of the minister influencing the case if he is allowed to continue in power, the chief minister said he sees no such reason. He, however, asserted that the ruling Telugu Desam is committed to check criminalisation of politics.

20,Simplification of labour laws imperative: Shenoy,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the amendments to Contract Labour Act, a top labour ministry official said simplification of labour laws was imperative for their easy implementation.

""There is plethora of labour laws, which needs to be simplified and made easily implementable,"" Labour Secretary P D Shenoy said here addressing a seminar, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

It was important to make the laws, which were in tune with the present situations and ""satisfy all stakeholders"", he said, emphasising on the human element of relations in the corporate world.

""Industrial Relation is 99 per cent human and one per cent legal relation,"" Shenoy said.

However, he added there was a need for attitude change for the employers, employees and trade unions.

A Sivananthiran, a senior official of International Labour Organisation, commended the Centre''s efforts to undertake reforms for the informal sector and said ILO would work in tandem with the Government, trade unions and industry to further the reforms in the sector.

A Group of Ministers, headed by Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani, is already looking into the Unorganised Sector Workers Bill, 2003, after a union Cabinet meeting referred it to the GoM.

The proposed Bill seeks to provide social security to the unorganised sector, which comprises around 93 per cent of the total labour force in the country.

21,Farmers suicide: YSR wants govt dismissed,"HYDERABAD: Opposition leader Y S Rajasekhara Reddy on Friday sought the intervention of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in dismissing the state government for its ''failure to protect farmers''.

Though the NHRC had reminded the government twice about the spate of suicides of farmers and also asked the chief minister to take corrective steps, Chandrababu Naidu had not taken any steps in this direction, Rajasekhara Reddy told reporters.

""The Congress party will request the NHRC to recommend to the Centre to invoke Article 356 and dismiss the TDP government,"" he said.

The Congress legislature party leader said that 169 farmers committed suicide in the state this year, for reasons ranging from crop failure to debt and unremunerative prices. He said Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh had also informed Parliament that over 500 farmers ended their lives in Andhra Pradesh during the last few years.

Rajasekhara Reddy said the NHRC had appointed retired IAS officer K R Venugopal to look into the issue, and the latter presented a detailed report on the suicides, besides suggesting remedial measures. ""The state government has kept the report in cold storage and not implemented a single recommendation,"" he said.

The CLP leader also ridiculed the housing minister Ramasubba Reddy''s refusal to quit from the cabinet, despite a High Court indictment.

""Ramasubba Reddy is thinking that why should he alone quit the cabinet, when several other ministers facing criminal charges are continuing in their posts,"" the Congress leader said.

22,UK dependence on India to increase: Young,"KOLKATA: Outgoing British high commissioner to India, Sir Rob Young, sees more English firms getting increasingly dependent on Indian companies in their quest to remain competitive at home.

Competition in Europe is intense and British firms realise that to remain in the race, they have to outsource back office operations to call centres and business process outsourcing units in India, Young said during his farewell visit to the city.

Though the ensuing job cuts in the UK have evoked strong protests from labour unions, Young pointed out that thousands of jobs had been created here in India. It should be a virtual circle. Indian firms too have been setting up shop in UK in large numbers, he pointed out.

Against 120 Indian companies that had investments in the UK three years ago, there are now 350 companies in the country. Nearly three-fourths of these are in the IT sector.

This is a measure of the confidence reposed by Indian firms in the British economy which is growing faster than any other in Europe, he said.

With India turning into a major outsourcing hub for British firms, the services component in the bilateral trade is expected to grow exponentially. Currently, services garner Â£1.2 billion of the Â£5 billion bilateral trade.

The envoy said the recent Hawk advanced jet trainers deal between India and UK would trigger large-scale local manufacturing in India and encourage British investors to tie up with Indian companies in the defence sector. It is a turning point in defence technology sector for the two countries, he said.

India is an emerging super-power and Britain realises that it cannot achieve its international objectives without Indiaâ€™s support, he said. UK backs Indiaâ€™s demand for a permanent membership to the UN security council.

24,VHP attacks BJP govt for not withdrawing Babri case,"NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Friday attacked the NDA government for lack of political will (sahas aur himmat) for not withdrawing the case against its leaders that has led to the framing of charges by Rae Bareli special court against Vishnu Hari Dalmia, Acharya Giriraj Kishore and others in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

VHP President Dalmia while reacting to the chargesheet against him said, ""this is just a politically motivated case filed to please the Muslims. Similar cases against George Fernandes and Sanjay Gandhi were withdrawn by earlier governments, but the BJP government does not have the will to do it.""

Dalmia said that VHP''s lawyers would decide whether to go on appeal against the court orders. Though both Dalmia and Vice-President Giriraj Kishore congratulated Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani for getting discharged from the case, Kishore attacked the country''s judicial system.

""We are following a defective colonial judicial system that acts only on people who get caught. We don''t accept the allegations against us. Even the earlier Congress governments had destroyed symbols of British rule. All that was done was to destroy the memorial of Babur who was an invader. Also, since Hindus had been offering prayers at the site, it was a temple that was pulled down for renovation,"" said Kishore.

Kishore said that the case was hanging fire over Advani all this while and now he would be able to perform better in the government with the court orders.

28,Inhalers linked to increased cataract risk,"LONDON: Thousands of asthma patients in the UK may be at risk of partial blindness after using steroid inhalers over long periods of time, it emerged here Thursday.

British researchers researchers found that inhaled steroids increased the risk of cataracts by up to 70 per cent in people over the age of 40.
