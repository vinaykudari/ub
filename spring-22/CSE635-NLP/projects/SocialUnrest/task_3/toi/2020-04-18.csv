0,Hosiery traders take out a shirt-less rally,"LUDHIANA: The desperation of agitating hosiery traders and manufacturers against imposition of central excise duty was evident when thousands of them including the labourers took out a shirtless protest march.

The agitation entered the fifth day after it was intensified through a chain hunger strike to be observed up to April 25 if the union government fails to rollback the duty. Led by joint action committee (JAC) members Raju Bindra, Vipin Vinayak, presidents of Punjab Hosiery Nirmata Sangh and Knitted Garments Manufacturers Association and FEKTAA leaders Vinod Thapar and Narinder Miglani, the protesters marched through Dal Bazar, Rai Bahadur Road, Chawal Bazar and Flahi Bazar areas in the city.

Later, they held a rally at Purana Bazar where they were, interestingly, joined by their labour. Bindra said they were compelled to take such step to awaken the government about their plight. He claimed that for the first time in the history of hosiery industry, the labour, too, joined them realising grave implications for them in case the duty is not withdrawn.

It is believed that hosiery workers are leaving for their native places in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar since the production work has come to standstill since March 31. We want to convey to the government about the antiindustry decision affecting lakhs of people involved in it through symbolic act of parading semi-clad, said Vinayak.

Conveying the mood of the industry, he warned the government about political fallout of their sustained stir. The agitating leaders warned about demonstration in front of local excise department office besides resorting to blocking rail and road traffic if the government failed to redress their problem within the deadline issued by them. They planned to shift scene of protest to Waitganj area on Saturday. The protesters observed hunger strike from 11 am to 5 pm.

1,School racket busted with three arrests,"KOLKATA: A gang which promised parents that their children would be admitted into the cityâ€™s top schools in exchange for large sums of money, was busted by officers of the detective department on Friday and the mastermind, Srikanta Mishra, finally put behind bars.

The anti-cheating section of city police busted the racket on Thursday night after arresting three persons, DC (DD) Soumen Mitra said. Earlier this year the Tiljala police had booked a woman on similar charges.

Matters first reached the police after Jignesh Rathode, a businessman complained that he had paid Rs 3,00,000 to Mishra in return for his sonâ€™s admission to the La Martineire for Boys School.

In his statement, Rathode said he had come across Mishra at a departmental store where the latter had befriended him. â€œHe flaunted his wide connections in elite school-circuits and promised Rathode that his son would gain admission to LMB,â€� Mitra said.

When they met again however, Mishra asked Rathode to cough up Rs 3,00,000 to â€œease the process of admissionâ€�. Rathode claimed he paid up since Mishra seemed â€œtrustworthy and genuineâ€�. Mishra even Rathode to La Martiniere twice and arranged a meeting with one R.S Pandey, supposedly the school administrator.

Rathode was completely taken in when Mishra even handed him his sonâ€™s pay-slip and booklist. â€œHe was asked to pay the admission fees to the bank adjacent to the school. But a week later the truth unfolded with the name of Rathodeâ€™s son no-where in the admission short-list,â€� Mitra said.

Rathode went to the school and met administrator R.S Pandey. To his shock he and found that the real R.S Pandey was a different man from the one he had met before. Realising he had been hoodwinked, he registered a complaint with the police.

The first person to be arrested was the durwan of the school Ram Ratan Giri, who had introduced Rathode to the â€˜fakeâ€™ Pandey. Police recovered a large number of the schoolâ€™s pay-slip books which he used to supply to the gang. Following Giriâ€™s confessions, Manoj Pandey of Motilal Basak Lane was picked up and charged with masquerading as R.S Pandey.

On Thursday evening the 45-yearold Mishra, was finally nabbed and Rs 80,000 receoved from him. All three are in custody.

2,'Butcher of Ghaziabad' arrested,"KOLKATA: The arrest of a contract killer and a leather merchant, from Ghaziabad in UP, finally brought down the curtains on the week-long New Market murder mystery on Friday.

A team from New Market police station comprising sergeant Alok Sanyal, sub-inspector Partha Mukherjee and constable Doodhpuri brought back Mohammed Soif alias Kallu and Mohammed Amjad from Dasna Gate Ghaziabadâ€™s Kassabagh area. The duo were arrested for the murder of leather merchants Tafseel Ahmed Khan and Mansoor Ali.

Khan and Ali were stabbed by Soif and Amjad on the night of April 11 on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. During interrogation it transpired that Soif, who supplied cow hide to city leather merchants, had been doing business with Khan and Ali for a long time. Khan and Ali manufactured finished products. Soif alleged that the duo owed him Rs 14 lakh.

â€œSoif often came to the city in the hope of receiving payment from them. During his visit about 20 days ago, Khan and Ali allegedly misbehaved with him. They told him that business was down and they could not pay him. They even threatened to â€˜finish him off â€™ if Soif disturbed them again,â€� deputy commissioner (central division) Zulfiquar Hasan said.

Enraged, Soif swore revenge. He went back to Ghaziabad and hired Amjad, a butcher, to kill the two businessmen. On April 10, Soif and Amjad returned to Kolkata and put up in a hotel in Zakaria Street.

â€œThey knew that every evening Khan and Ali visited traders from UP lodged at hotels along Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. On April 11, they lay in wait near the Muslim Institute. Around 8.45 pm, when Khan and Ali came out of a nearby hotel, Soif pounced on Ali and stabbed him while Amjad hit Khan. Both succumbed to their injuries. That very night, Soif and Amjad took a train and went back to Ghaziabad,â€� Hasan said. Acting on a tip-off, a K. team left for Ghaziabad on April 12.

4,"Govt officer, cop arrested in narcotics racket","KOLKATA/BASHIRHAT: To all his neighbours and colleagues, Patitpaban Sarkar was an industrial development officer with the state government. That he was also the kingpin of an inter-state narcotics racket, was discovered only on Friday.

In a coordinated effort over the last 48 hours, the Howrah and North 24 Parganas police busted the inter-state narcotic-racket run by Pathak and his gang of six, which included among others another government employee â€” Kolkata police fourth battalion constable Uday Mondal. They were found to be in possession of a large cache of heroin and Crystal Morphine weighing around 190 gram and worth over Rs 30 lakh, senior police officers of Howrah and North 24 Parganas district confirmed.

The first link in the chain was found on Wednesday night when acting on a tip-off, the Liluah police arrested Patitpaban Sarkar, an industrial development officer with the Hasnabad Block Development Office. Sarkar broke down and his confessions led to the further arrests in Basirhat and Kolkata. Investigation revealed that narcotic consignment was smuggled into India from Bangladesh and dispatched to the city and its suburbs with the help of large network of peddlers.

Sarkar, a resident of Chamraile in Howrah, was actually caught in the act as he was disposing off part of a consignment. Howrah SP Rajesh Kumar said Sarkar would sell crystal morphine under the label of uranium oxide.

The gang was finally busted though in the early hours of Friday when a joint raid resulted in seven arrests. Ishar Ali, Ansarali Sardar, Sirajul Islam, Mohd. Mannan Hussain, Gulam Baksha Mondal and constable Uday Mondal are now in custody. Police said Sirajul Islam is an influential fish merchant and owns several wholesale markets in Basirhat. Sirajul, police said, was the main financier. Senior district police officers said the final raid was carried out at Ansar Ali Sardarâ€™s decorator shop in Basirhat. The 190 grams heroine stock was stored in this shop.

The police believe this particular racket had flourished over the least seven-eight months. Sarkar used to liaison with a large number of young men from his Hasnabad office and ensured their participation in the network which proved to be extremely lucrative.

CPM cadres arrested: Dispensing â€˜instant justiceâ€™ proved costly for two CPM supporters. Party cadres Shekhar Nag and Alokendu Saha had allegedly beaten up Ananta Das and Barun Thakur, at the Shovabazar party office, for assaulting a handicapped youth on Tuesday evening.

However, the police were not impressed by their efforts to hand out â€˜justice.â€™ The two CPM men were promptly arrested on Thursday. Though they were granted bail, the incident assumed political significance. Ananta and Barun, who are local youths, assaulted a handicapped boy, Subhas Raha, on Tuesday. Raha then complained to Shekhar and Alokendu, who along with other CPM supporters severely beat up Ananta and Barun. However, the two men went on to lodge a complaint with the Shyampukur police station against the CPM cadres.

5,Builder arrested for threatening woman,"NEW DELHI: A builder has been arrested for allegedly threatening a woman to sell her property. Pawan Kumar Saraswat has also been accused of forging signatures and preparing fake sale deeds.

Saraswat, who is in police custody, is already accused of threatening and molesting the womanâ€™s mother who died few years ago. A senior police official said Saraswat was infamous for grabbing land and constructing illegal shops.

â€˜â€˜His main area of operation was the Walled City. He would choose disputed properties that were involved in cases pending in court,â€™â€™ said deputy commissioner of police (north) Sanjay Baniwal.

According to the police, Ruchi Kohli, who lives with her husband and child, owns property worth crores. â€˜â€˜The property is hereditary and most of it is in Chandni Chowk,â€™â€™ a police officer said.

Kohli also owns a building near The Fountain police post. There are shops on the ground floor and first floor of the building. The market value of the property was over a crore, a police officer said.

Few months ago, Saraswat contacted Kohli. He sent his accomplice Shyam Sunder Aggarwal to meet her. Aggarwal apparently left a sale deed with Kohli. The deed contained signatures of Saraswat, Aggarwal and an intended purchaser, Ramesh Dubey. It also mentioned the amount, Rs 74 lakh, which Dubey was willing to pay for the property.

When Kohli told Saraswat she was not interested and had destroyed the deed, the accused allegedly sent her another sale deed. This time the intended purchaser was one Rajinder Dalmia. Saraswat had also sent Rs seven lakh as token money.

On Kohliâ€™s complaint, the police team, under assistant commissioner of police (operations) L S Brar, verified the sale deeds. The investigations revealed the purchasers were not aware of them. They told the police that their signatures had been forged.

7,State govt to build 100 barrages,"BELGAUM: The Karnataka government has decided to build 100 barrages over the main rivers, canals and big lakes to improve conditions for irrigation,â€™â€™ said H.K. Patil, minister for irrigation, here on Friday.

Addressing reporters Patil highlighted the importance of the Markandeya Project which irrigates more than 40,000 acres of land. The project is estimated to cost Rs 209 crore, out of which, already Rs 165 crore has been spent. To a query regarding job opportunities being created for the displaced families, he said, about 5 per cent of government jobs under C & D schemes have been reserved for such families, and compensation is being paid to them.

About Rs 6.3 crore is the estimated to be the cost for rehabiltation of these families, which includes housing, school, hospitals, post-offices and other essential amenities, the minister said. About the Ghataprabha and Malaprabha project, Patil claimed that for the first time in the country, a Water Usersâ€™ Co-operative Federation has been formed.

8,CMDF: Clear rules needed,"LUCKNOW: Refusing to be drawn into any controversy over the BJP stand on the â€˜politics of personal vendetta and the filing of FIRsâ€™, irrigation minister Om Prakash Singh on Friday parried all queries on this count with the observation that â€œthe party president has given his statement on the issue and it is applicable on all BJP membersâ€�. He, however, stressed that the BJP-BSP alliance was still strong and would last its full term in office.

Singh, during the course of a press conference, clarified his views on the chief ministerâ€™s discretionary fund (CMDF) as the issue had been holding centre stage for long. He said the time had now come to formulate very clear guidelines and rules for the use of discretionary fund and the practice of sanctioning funds on whims and fancies should be done away with. He said this was necessary in order to ensure any semblance of â€˜vyawasthaâ€™ (order) in the present day politics.

Singh said it was lamentable that the present day politics in Uttar Pradesh had taken on the hue of personal vendetta. During the past few years, those who occupied the chief ministerâ€™s chair allowed their personal differences to be politicised. The turning point in this kind of politics was the infamous State Guest House incident of June 1995. Since then, the politics of personal vendetta had established roots in UP, he said.

He denied that the BSP was ignoring the BJP on any count and said the party had implemented many of its programmes, including ban on cow slaughter, holding the same stand as the NDA government at the Centre on the Ram Janambhoomi case and denial to issue a fresh notification in the same case.

9,Commodities flow in despite truckers' strike,"PUNE: Supply of vegetables, fruits, onions and potatoes to the city improved on Friday, even as the indefinite nationwide strike of transporters entered the fifth day, with no breakthrough in sight.

The district supply office, which is monitoring the strike situation, told TNN that supply of milk, petrol, diesel and vegetables continued unhindered and there was no shortage of essential commodities in the market.

The administration did not have to requisition private vehicles or even state transport buses as the goods continue to come in small tempos, jeeps and over 60 trucks.

Ghanshyam Jedhe, officer at the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) said that the Gultekdi market yard received 143 vehicles carrying onions and potatoes, 10 vehicles loaded with leafy vegetables, 131 vehicles carrying fruits and 143 brought in assorted vegetables. The prices remained stable.

As compared to 273 vehicles which brought in supplies on Thursday, the number of vehicles went up to 427 on Friday, Jedhe said. The total number of supply vehicles worked out to 603 (as compared to 448 on Thursday) which included those carrying supplies to Hadapsar vegetable market, grocery market and flower market.

Mohan Oswal, president of Poona Merchants Chamber said that except for coconuts, the city had adequate stock of all grocery items. â€œSupply of coconuts has gone down due to the strike, as a result of which the price of coconut bags (having 100 to 125 nuts) has gone up by up to Rs 50,â€� he said.

Traders have adequate stocks of other grocery items, including sugar and edible oil, and the prices were stable, he added. Meanwhile, there was no breakthrough in the ongoing strike of transporters and the second round of talks between the state government and transporters did not materialise in the morning.

Baba Shinde, vice-president of the Maharashtra State Truck, Tempo, Tanker and Bus Transporters Association, said the government wanted the association to withdraw the strike before coming for the second round of talks. â€œWe requested them to give us concrete assurances about our demand for more time to fit Euro-II engines and withdrawing of Rs 500 fine. But the government was not ready,â€� Shinde claimed.

The transporters want two to five years to fit Euro-II engines as they had become available very recently. â€œThis would have saved 27,000 vehicles in the state,â€� Shinde said, adding that the government wanted them to pay fine in advance for a no-objection certificate to ply the old vehicles. The association also pointed out to the lack of adequate compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations in Mumbai.

The transportersâ€™ association, meanwhile, has assured chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde that they would not disturb transport of mangoes from the Konkan to other parts of the state and country. â€œWe are aware that mangoes are perishable.We have asked the chief minister not to arrange police escorts for trucks carrying mangoes,â€� Shinde said.

14,"Day 1 of visit: Strikes, arrests and cheers","SRINAGAR: Srinagar city wore a deserted look, with the general public remaining indoors on Friday in the wake of a general strike called by separatists and various militant outfits against the Prime Ministersâ€™ two-day visit to Kashmir.

All shops and business establishments and educational institutions remained closed for the day. The unprecedented security arrangements deterred people from moving in the streets.

However, small groups of people under the watchful eyes of the security personnel could be seen going towards the Sher-e-Kashmir Cricket Stadium where Vajpayee addressed his first public meeting.

Calling for a two-day strike coinciding with Vajpayeeâ€™s visit, the Hurriyat Conference had said the separatist conglomerate would extend full cooperation if a meaningful dialogue was initiated to resolve the Kashmir issue.

Pro-Pakistan militant outfit, the Hizbul Mujahidin and other local militant organisations had also called for a strike against the Prime Ministerâ€™s visit.

Meanwhile, BSF personnel on Friday gunned down three Lashker-e-Toiba militants in an encounter in Anantnag districtâ€™s Yaripora village, about 15 km from where the PM is to attend a public function in Qazigund on Saturday.

There was unprecedented security with mobile police teams patrolling every nook and corner of the city. Hours before the Prime Minister arrived here, the police detained JKLF vice-president Javid Ahmad Mir when he tried to take out a procession of activists of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons.

Policemen, who were on high alert for the visit and deployed in strength in the city, detained the separatist leader when he came out of a hotel in Srinagar on Friday morning, official sources said. Mir has been lodged in the Kothibagh police station. According to the police, Mir wanted to create a law and order problem coinciding with Vajpayeeâ€™s visit.

Meanwhile at the rally Vajpayee was greeted with cheers and women danced at the venue. He congratulated the people of the state for exercising their right to vote â€˜â€˜at grave risk to their livesâ€™â€™. He said people had ridiculed him when he announced from the Red Fortâ€™s ramparts that polls would be held in the state. While assuring the people that all efforts would be made to provide jobs, he urged the state government to lay stress on IT to open up employment avenues.

Chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, Governor G C Saxena and civil aviation minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain were among those present.

15,It won't be easy for BJP in assembly polls,"NEW DELHI: While the BJP wants to stay on the â€˜â€˜right sideâ€™â€™ of the VHP and its leaders like Praveen Togadia, currently in jail for launching a trishul deeksha ceremony in Rajasthan, it is not placing its faith in Hindutva to win the ensuing assembly polls in the state.

Senior party sources said the caste factor in virtually every constituency in the state would override any attempt to â€˜â€˜uniteâ€™â€™ Hindus, through distribution of trishuls or otherwise.

Though the BJP considers Rajasthan a cakewalk, it is taking no chances. It is trying to consolidate its base among the Rajputs, Jats and Brahmins and stoke the anti-incumbency factor against Ashok Gehlot.

The BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate, Vasundhara Raje, was chosen for her relative youth and lack of any baggage. The problem is that it hasnâ€™t gone down so well with the state unit.

The second easiest state, the BJP feels, is Madhya Pradesh. Here, too, the chief ministerial candidate, Uma Bharati, is touring the state in a rath.

Poor roads, lack of power and water haunts the 10-year-old Digvijay Singh government, but the BJP state unit remains deeply divided. Recently, the group opposed to Uma, headed by state chief Kailash Joshi, met at Union minister Vikram Vermaâ€™s residence in Delhi.

The party leadershipâ€™s creation of an anomaly in retaining Joshi as state chief while projecting Uma as its chief ministerial candidate has led to a rift.

This is also the case in Chhattisgarh, the second most difficult state, admits a senior BJP leader. The party made Union minister Raman Singh quit to become state chief, but realised later that party MP Dilip Singh Judeo, known for his zeal for â€˜â€˜re-conversionâ€™â€™, provided the Hindu â€˜â€˜muscularityâ€™â€™ needed to counter CM Ajit Jogi. The BJP also hopes to tie up with the NCP in the state, recently strengthened by the entry of Congressman V C Shukla.

In Delhi, regarded as the toughest state by the BJP, the leadership is currently engaged in assuaging state unit chief Madanlal Khuranaâ€™s feelings. He was upset by reports that he was being replaced by Union law minister Arun Jaitley.

The other major problem is that though the Capitalâ€™s demographic picture has changed with the influx from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttaranchal, the BJP is seen primarily as a Punjabi party, still living in a post-partition warp.

16,"Jamali says Musharraf is boss, Oppn protests","ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan''s opposition continued to lodge protest over Pervez Musharraf''s presidency and his constitutional amendments, Premier Mir Zafarulla Khan Jamali has said he considered the President his ""boss"" who doesn''t need any approval from Parliament to remain in power.

Jamali said he has no hesitation in admitting that he considered Musharraf his ""boss"" while opposition parties termed Musharraf an ""illegal"" president and a ""stranger"", vowing to continue to oppose him.

With the opposition members successfully disrupting the proceedings in the National Assembly and Senate on Friday, Jamali declared that Musharraf was an elected President and needed no approval from Parliament.

After pandemonium, the National Assembly was adjourned to April 21 while the Senate was prorogued after a five-hour standoff between the opposition and ruling party members.

Tensions rose in the Senate as some women members of the ruling pro-military Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) tried to indulge in counter slogan shouting in favour of Musharraf to match the anti-Musharraf slogans of the opposition.

As both the Houses were adjourned, Jamali turned down the opposition demand to hold direct talks with Musharraf, saying that the General was ""my boss"".

Jamali said the opposition leaders could get to the President only if they ""cross"" PML-Q leaders.

""They can go forward only if they were able to cross us. They have seen only one side of the picture yet,"" he said.

The demand for direct talks with Musharraf was made by Islamist alliance Muthahida Majlis-e Amal (MMA) Secretary- General Maulana Fazlur Rahman on Friday. He proposed that Musharraf should hold direct talks with the opposition on a constitutional package to end the current political deadlock.

Rahman said Gen Zia-ul Haq had held direct talks with the opposition on a constitutional package which ended the political impasse in 1985, and Musharraf should follow suit.

He alleged that neither the Jamali government nor PML-Q negotiating team had any credible mandate from the President for a give-and-take in talks with the opposition.

Earlier the opposition members described Musharraf as a ""stranger"" as his Presidential election through referendum was not recognised by Parliament. ""A stranger cannot be allowed to address the parliament,"" MMA President Shah Ahmad Noorani said addressing a press conference with leaders of Pakistan People''s Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N).

Noorani said the authority of one man to amend the constitution was not acceptable to opposition.

Terming the constitutional amendments brought in by Musharraf as illegal, he said if the government wants them to be approved in the national interest, the amendments should be placed before the National Assembly for approval.

Noorani said amendments by one man would give birth to ""ugly"" tradition, adding the constitution has stipulated that President should be elected by Parliament and assemblies, and not by referendum. ""There is an electoral college for the election of the president.""

17,CM's fund use since '94 will be probed: Mayawati,"LUCKNOW: Faced with charges of political vendetta following slapping of a plethora of cases against Samajwadi Party leaders, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Saturday said misuse of discretionary funds distributed during the tenures of three BJP chief ministers and herself since 1994 would also be probed.

She also directed officials not to arrest SP leaders charged with misuse of discretionary funds just on the basis of FIRs lodged against them, without getting a clearance from the court.

""Impartial and just inquiries would be conducted into the various cases since 1994 to establish that the money sanctioned by the government through discretionary fund was not not misused and all those found guilty of using the money for means other than it was sanctioned for would be taken to task"", the Chief Minister told reporters here.

She said inquiries into these cases would be limited to misuse of funds by the beneficiaries.

Mayawati said BJP chief ministers Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta and Rajnath Singh and she could not be held responsible for flouting rules since Mulayam Singh Yadav had raised the limit for sanctioning financial help during his tenure in 1994.

In an apparent tone down of her offensive against SP, she said officials have been directed not to arrest the accused in the various cases of misuse of discreationary fund and doctoring of CD and cassette without getting a clearance from the court.

On cases of misuse of funds by beneficiaries during the tenure of Congress leader Moti Lal Vohra as governor, Mayawati said she had no intention to take any action that would undermine the authority and sanctity of the governor''s office. She said inquiries have only been ordered into the misuse of funds by beneficiaries. The cases against SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav have been lodged as ""he flouted the existing rules in distribution of fund and sanctioned money above the prescribed limit"", the Chief Minister said.

She flayed SP leaders Amar Singh and Mohd. Azam Khan for alledly using derogatory language in their criticism of her government.

Mayawati warned that filing of FIRs would not be allowed to be used as an excuse by individuals or political parties to disturb peace in the state.

""All those trying to disturb the law and order of the state on this pretext would be taken to task"", she added.

The Chief Minister said senior IAS officer and Secretary, Industrial Development, J S Deepak, has been asked to probe the various cases of misuse of discretionary funds by its beneficiaries.

Mayawati said none of the central or state BJP leaders have held her action of filing FIRs against Yadav and others as wrong.

Those who have gone on records against it have merely expressed their personal views, she claimed.

The Chief Minister denied that her meeting with three senior BJP leaders later in the day had been convened to discuss the situation arising out of filing of FIRs.

The meeting with state BJP president Vinay Katiyar, incharge of party affairs Kalraj Misra and legislature party leader Lalji Tandon has been convened to formalise the strategy of the ruling BSP-BJP coalition for the coming bye-election to lone assembly seat next month, she added.

Discussions on the political situation in the state was not not on the agenda and there was no question of it being taken up at the meeting, the Chief Minister said in reply to a question.

Misra had on Friday said that the state party leaders would be meeting the central party leadership in a day or two to discuss the political situation arising out of the ongoing slandering between BSP and Samajwadi Party.
