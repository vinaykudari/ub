0,Tax breather for farmhouse owners,"NEW DELHI: Owners of most farmhouses in the city can ring in the New Year with a smile. Except for those situated in south Delhi, all farmhouses have been downgraded from ''A'' category for assessment of property tax under the new unit area method.

The recommendation is part of an interim report prepared by the Municipal Valuation Committee (MVC). The committee will submit its report on Thursday.

Farmhouse owners had sent in representations that a uniform high property tax would spell a death knell for them. They requested that since the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was not providing them with any facilities like sanitation, roads or water, they should not be equated in the same tax bracket as farmhouses in posh areas like Sainik Farms and Mehrauli.

""There are many farmhouses which get brackish water and take care of their own trash collection. We have decided to downgrade their classification according to the locality they are placed in,"" said a senior MCD official.

Public utilities, hospitals and schools will also be examined on a case to case basis so that charitable institutions are not placed at par with profit making organisations. ""We have placed hospitals and schools in one category but a separate committee will be set up to provide differential assessment since there are several sub-classifications in both institutions,""added an MVC member.

The committee will provide separate rates for those schools that are run by business houses, trusts and those run by charities or government -aided schools.

Municipal commissioner Rakesh Mehta said that not many changes have been made in the rates.

""We have decided to fix a uniform rate for properties that are less than 100 square metre. Residents can contest this rate if they feel that the property tax is too high,"" Mehta added. Over 50 per cent of properties in Delhi fall in this bracket.
