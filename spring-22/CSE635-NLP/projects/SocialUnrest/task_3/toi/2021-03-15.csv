1,VMC plan to enforce rule on detailed death report,"VADODARA: Civic authorities will not issue a death certificate if a death report prepared by doctors does not detail the exact cause.

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) health department which issues birth and death certificates told representatives from the medical fraternity and NGOs at a workshop recently that the scheme, introduced in January 2003, would be fully enforced from mid-July.

The new system requires death reports or Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) prepared by attending physicians to categorise death as institutional (form 4), and domicialiary (form 4A).

Institutional deaths are those that occur in medical colleges, civil, zonal or referral hospitals, government health centres. Domiciliary are those occurring at tertiary or referral hospitals (hospitals associated with government hospitals), private nursing homes and health centres and private clinics.

Both form 4 and 4A require a detailed explanation into the cause of death. This include a separate column which asks the physician to mention the immediate causes, such as â€˜the disease injury or complication which caused death and not the mode of dying, for example heart failureâ€™.

It also demands antecedent causes, like morbid conditions which might have led to the conditions mentioned under â€˜immediate causesâ€™ section.

It further seeks an overall physical condition of the deceased,which should not be related to a disease or condition causing it, obesity, for instance.

An important feature is that it makes it mandatory for public health centres at the taluka level and nursing homes to report stillbirths. The data will be fed into a software, PRISM, that would collate data of births, deaths, stillbirths and causes. This data could be accessed by planners on the internet.

The MCCD scheme provides cause specific mortality profiles which is a key indicator to analyse health trends in a scientific fashion. It also provides reliable data on the causes of mortality. Administrators, public health planners, medical professionals and research workers can tap this data.

â€œIt also prevents practitioners from tampering with death reports as it demands a detailed and categorised explanation into the cause of death,â€� says VMC medical officer and registrar of births and deaths Dhurandar Pathak.

A civic official said fake death reports could have been earlier procured, but in the new system its incidence could be reduced.

The scheme also makes it mandatory for the in-charge of a medical institution to sign a particular death report as the main informant of the event (death). It will also plug inconsistencies that occur between â€˜cause of deathâ€™ stated in a death report and medical certificate.

The system ensures that a particular death be reported the same day and the registration be done the following day. The scheme also bars registration officers to attest a death report that does not fall under their jurisdiction.

However, where the cause of death is not known to the attending doctor, that is, if the patient is brought dead, or dies unattended, cases of accidents, homicide, suicide, where foul play is suspected â€”a post-mortem report should be attached to the MCCD and a death certificate will be issued within 21 days.

This is the same for cases of deaths caused by burns, especially in case of married women.

2,Eateries in Ahmedabad to shut down at 11 pm,"AHMEDABAD: Eating out in the night in western parts of Ahmedabad may never be the same again as the city police have decided to ensure that all restaurants, shops and even medicine stores down shutters at 11 pm.

Sources said that the move is directed at crime-control before polls. The police have take up this mode of preventive policing because of the rising number of property crimes and thefts.

Joint CP (sector I) P C Thakur said: â€œAccording to the rules, restaurants and eateries cannot function beyond 11 pm. Only those with a licence for 24-hour operation can. Police investigations have proved that roadside eateries are often used by miscreants as rendezvous. It becomes difficult to distinguish between crooks and the common man at such places.â€�

This move, however, has not gone down well with the masses and hoteliers.

A resident of Satellite, Sanjiv Bhatt, said: â€œAs it is, there is no night-life in Ahmedabad. We could occasionally have fun by going out icecream parlours and eating joints late at night. Now, even this is not possible.â€�

According to a prominent restaurant owner, who has outlets at Navrangpura, Ellisbridge and on the Gandhinagar-Sarkhej highway: â€œSome restaurant owners were roughed up and beaten, together with being asked to pay a penalty. This practice will lead to corruption.â€�

Congress municipal councillor and president of Ahmedabad Hotel Ownersâ€™ Association, Narendra Brahmbhatt, said: â€œWe will take up the matter with the chief minister. This rule has to be relaxed in order to allow people continue with their lifestyle.â€�

Health care professional Sanjiv Dhavan, however, supported the 11 pm deadline for eateries. â€œIncidents of petty crime and hooliganism are on the rise. This is a good move since roadside eateries, tea stalls, paan and cigarette shops also draw anti-socials. Besides, refraining from food late at night is good for health too.â€�

3,Cricket meets politics: Cong performs 'Yagna',"VADODARA: Priyanka and Rahul''s presence in Karachi to witness India beat Pakistan in the first One-Dayer seems to have inspired local Congress leaders at Anand to team up with Team India as well.

No, they are not packing their bags and leaving for Pakistan. There is an election to fight here after all. So the Anand Yuva Congress Samiti organised a â€˜Vijay Yagnaâ€™ at the party office on Sunday.

The aim was to pray for the Indian team''s security and victory.

To the layman, this may seem like the ideal way of mixing cricket and politics â€” the two hottest topics currently.

But the Congress leaders insist that it was a purely nonpolitical move.

Around 200 party workers from across the district joined the â€˜yagnaâ€™. Photographs of players were garlanded and even bats, balls and sticks were kept aside the â€˜yagna kundâ€™. The workers chanted â€˜mantrasâ€™ for the teamâ€™s victory in the Indo-Pak series.

Anand Yuva Congress leader Amit Chavda claimed, â€œHindus and Muslims prayed for the teamâ€™s success.â€�Chavda is son of outgoing Anand MP Ishwar Chavda.

4,Will reopening riot cases reveal more skeletons?,"AHMEDABAD: The skeletons that surfaced from a riverbed in Dahod, when the CBI reopened the Bilkis Bano case, may not be the only ones being revealed for the state government.

Lawyers feel that many of the post-Godhra riot cases, almost 50 per cent of which have been closed for â€œwant of evidenceâ€�, may turn out to be similar to the Bilkis case if reopened.

There were over 4,200 offences registered in the state in the rioting that raged in 2002. Nearly half of them have been placed in the â€˜A-Final categoryâ€™â€” meaning cases closed for want of evidence.

According to sources in the Gujarat Police, chargesheets have been filed in only 2,037 cases in various criminal courts all over the state.

In six districts, the number of cases registered but not investigated is alarmingly high. In Rajkot city, for instance, of the 198 cases registered, as many as 190 are yet to be investigated.

In Sabarkantha, of the 460-odd cases, over 275 have not been probed.

Similar is the case in districts like Mehsana (90 out of over 170), Banaskantha (45 out of over 60 cases), Dahod (60 out of nearly 90 cases) and Vadodara rural (nearly 150 out of over 240 cases).

In Ahmedabad, of the 950-odd cases, 350 have yet to be investigated.

State home secretary K Nityanandam refused to comment when asked whether the state government was focusing only on cases related to the Sabarmati Express carnage.

However, a senior police official told TNN that in most of the riot cases, police personnel had to become complainants as in those times of emergency, nobody turned up to register offences. â€œThe police couldnâ€™t get enough eye-witnesses and evidence to prove the incidents,â€� he says.

â€œThe problem faced by the police is that there are not enough witnesses,â€� says AK Bhargava, DGP (in-charge).

When asked whether other closed cases may go the Bilkis Bano way, Bhargava says, â€œBilkis Bano is an isolated case.â€�

However, according to lawyers handling riot cases, besides the several omnibus FIRs that were filed after the riots, the fact that many cases have been clubbed together has also created many loopholes. However, Bhargava says that there is a provision in the law to club such cases.

While state law minister Ashok Bhatt refused to comment on the issue, home minister Amit Shah said: â€œThe number (of cases closed) seems to be high because a large number of cases have been clubbed together.â€�

Shah refused to comment on the Bilkis Bano case, saying that â€œit would be improper to say anything before the CBI completes its inquiryâ€�.

Shah, however, justified the state governmentâ€™s decision to clamp Pota on the Godhra carnage accused and not on all the accused in post-Godhra riots.

â€œThe decision to clamp Pota was taken after it was revealed during investigation that money was pumped in from outside the country.

We cannot treat riots cases and cases of conspiracy against the country in the same fashion,â€� says Shah.

6,"CPI(M) is ""positive threat"" to free and fair election: Priya","KOLKATA: The senior Congress leader Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi today alleged that the ruling CPI(M) is a ""positive threat"" to holding a free and fair election in West Bengal because of its growing ""misuse"" of the police force and deployment of ""party hoodlums"" to rig the polls.

""In West Bengal, CPI(M) being in power is itself a threat to the objective of the Election Commission to hold a free and fair poll with the growing misuse of police machinery by it and also encouraging the party hoodlums to rig the poll"" Dasmunshi told a party workers meeting launching the Congress campaign for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls in the state.

Dasmunshi, a Congress Working Committee member who will seek re-election from Raiganj Lok Sabha seat in North Bengal, said ""CPI(M) should read the writings on the wall and not create a situation of terror in the state.""

The Congress leader also took the Marxists to task, holding them ""responsible"" for the growth of ""communal"" forces in the country and called upon the leftists to back the Congress to oust the NDA from power.

""The CPI(M) is historically responsible for strengthening of the communal forces because it shared a common platform in 1977 and 1989 with them while it maintained an anti-Congress stance.""

""It is time for them (Marxists) to understand the threat from the communal forces and co-operate to the cohesive understanding of the secular democratic forces to correct the mistakes. The left forces should coperate with the Congress movement to oust the NDA at this juncture"", he said.

7,RJD govt blamed for plight of Brahmins,"PATNA: Though participants in the state-level Sarva Brahmin Maharally held in Gandhi Maidan here on Sunday avoided giving any political message, president of Vishwa Shanti Mission Vinod Pandey said that honour and status of Brahmins in the state came in danger from 1990, when the state government espousing the cause of ""social justice"" was formed.

Though he did not mention the name of RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, he drove his point home when he said that some leaders from the ""1974 movement"" came to power and formed ""social justice government"" that started the decline of Brahmins in the state.

Pandey, whom speakers mentioned as the brain and inspiration behind formation of the organisation of brahmins and also the rally held on Sunday, said that the social justice government of (Laloo) has been trying to bring revolution through legal means, implicitly by extending reservation facility to weaker and depressed sections, but it was unlikely to make any substantial change in the society, as ""samskar"" of the concerned could not be transformed by this method.

Stating that ""samskar"" was something passed on to a person by birth, he said that only brahmins possessed it naturally. ""Brahmins have never given the slogan to oil lathis, and would not give it even in the future,"" Pandey said, adding that Manu had talked only about four ''varnas'', but the social justice government had divided the society into 237 castes.

Pandey said that Brahmins would have to shape their future in such a way that their unity, both in northern and southern parts of the country, remained intact. He said all brahmin castes and groups should have marital relations among them, and they would have to also think about refugee Brahmins from J&K.

Maharally coordinator S N Dubey was also present on the occasion.
