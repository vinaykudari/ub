2,LBP to focus on CAG report for polls,"bathinda: balwant singh ramoowalia of the lok bhalai party (lbp) has decided to make the comptroller and auditor-general (cag) report on the purchase of coffins, the theme of the party campaign, for the upcoming assembly elections. by doing so, ramoowalia, who was addressing mediapersons, here, on saturday, is hoping to garner support from the 1,90,000 serving army personnel, the lakhs of exservicemen and the families of kargil martyrs in punjab. he believes the details of the irregularities committed in clearing defence deals, mentioned in a copy of the cag report, will help the party in extending its base. he added that the bjp-led nda government had fallen ''in the eyes of the country''. ''the shiromani akali dal (badal) was a part of the kafan-chor gang. the people of punjab will show them their rightful place during the assembly elections,'' he said. speaking about the corrupt practices of the sad(b)-bjp government, he said that the government had bestowed 735 bus route passes to party mps, mlas, sgpc members and their relatives, during the last five years. ''no bus passes were allotted to needy persons,'' he alleged. ramoowalia also charged the ruling party with selling off public property at ''throw away prices'' to party leaders. he said he would include cancelling of bus routes in the party manifesto, besides, restoration of the status of government property and prosecution of the guilty. the president said that the lbp would contest the elections from 90 seats and was hopeful of bagging at least 60. he accused the sad(b) and congress of using religion for gaining political mileage. ramoowalia said his party had decided to gherao each political leader, particularly of the ruling congress party, when they launch their campaign here in punjab.

3,Parties vie to take ‘credit’ for veto on helmet rule,"pune: the state government's widely publicised intention to withdraw its own ordinance on the compulsory use of helmets for twowheeler riders, has sent political parties scambling to take the credit for this patently anti-people move. political parties, sensing that a vocal and influential section of the public did not take kindly to this somewhat cumbersome safety measure, were in the forefront of the movement to have the order scrapped. each one now views the government's backtracking on the issue as a success for itself.trouble is, no one party can claim the 'credit' and consequently they are vieing with each other to hold press conferences boasting of their 'victory'. while the bjp-ss hinted at dark conspiracies, the congress ingeniously but unconvincingly lobbed the ball back into the bjp's court. the bjp-shiv sena joint press conference on saturday was addressed by bjp mlas girish bapat and vishwas gangurde, party mlc prakash javdekar and shiv sena mlas deepak paigude and vinayak nimhan. they claimed the government was forced to withdraw the decision owing to their strong protest.they announced that they would follow up the matter and ensure that the government withdraws the ordinance within a fortnight. congress city unit chief mohan joshi claimed that the decision on helmets had been taken by the state as per guidelines issued by the central government led by the bjp! he boasted that the congress was the first political party in the city to have initiated an agitation against helmet compulsion.

4,Kanshi declares Mayawati political heir,"lucknow: at a massive rally at the laxman mela ground, bahujan samaj party supremo kanshi ram on saturday declared mayawati as his political heir to carry forward the mission of establishing a 'manavtawadi samaj' replacing the existing 'manuvadi governance'. addressing the rally, ram, who arrived in came to lucknow after many years, reminisced how the movement to bring the deprived sections under a political umbrella had traversed through a tortuous path in the past. the movement, launched by jyotiba phule a hundred years ago to coalesce dalits into a powerful unit, should be continued till the 'manuvadi' system of governance was replaced by a government based on egalitarian ethos, said ram. ram explained the reasons for his absence in lucknow to the crowd who repeatedly cheered him. he said the bahujan samaj party which had become the third biggest party in the country should aspire for the top slot, if the nation was to be saved from destruction. for placing the bahujan samaj party on the top slot, it should be number one party in 10 to 12 states, he said. he said that a look into growth of congress, bjp and the communists showed that these parties took around fifty to seventy years to reach the position of eminence. but the bahujan samaj party, he said, captured the third slot in ten years. in 1996, the election commission declared it a national party which was a unique feat, ram said adding, now the thrust would be to make it a hukamrano ki party (rulers party). on coming assembly polls in some states, the bsp supremo said that in punjab his party would make a serious bid to capture power. on performance of the nda government, the bsp president said that it was like a cart being pulled by many horses in different directions. ram asked the assembled crowd to continue their fight against the 'manuvadi' system with all sincerity of purpose and said in his absence mayawati would lead them. profusely praising mayawati, the bsp supremo said: mayawati's achievement during her chief ministership was tremendous. what she did in six months was equal to five years work. ram said mayawati never wavered in her mission and worked for the cause of the bahujan samaj with complete dedication. mayawati in her 45-minute speech set the agenda for party workers. she began her speech by reminding the gathering how the congress party had tried to sabotage ambedkar's entry into the constituent assembly. mayawati continuously referred to gandhi and nehru. she held these leaders responsible for the plight of dalits and said had the britishers not been there, ambedkar would not have been able to stay in the constituent assembly. then she came down to mulayam, holding him solely responsible for the survival of the bjp government. she said the bjp leaders had bowed before kanshi ram to seek his support for the rotational chief ministership. she said once bjp assumed power, it rescinded all decisions taken for helping the dalits. but we paid back by voting out the vajpayee government at the time of vote of confidence at the centre, she said asking the bsp workers to teach them a lesson at the time of elections. on attack on parliament, she said the central government should quit owing the responsibility for its failure to protect the epitome of democracy.

9,"UK relaxes policy, invites skilled immigrants","ahmedabad: uk can turn into a hot destination for you, if you are a highly skilled professional, earning rs 10 lakh a year. under the new scheme, highly skilled migrant programme (hsmp), heralding the biggest relaxation in immigration policy for 30 years. home office minister, lord rooker, announced in london on thursday that talented people with exceptional skills, abilities or experience will be able to come to the uk to seek work. this policy, based on points system similar to a canadian model, is intended to attract highly skilled and high-earning migrants to fill the skills shortages. lord rooker, minister for citizenship and immigration, said, ""at the moment, it is not possible for individuals other than those with ancestral ties to the uk, to come to this country to seek and take up work without a job offer. this makes it very difficult to attract highly mobile people with the special talents that are required in a modern economy. this programme is specifically designed to help highly skilled migrants come to the uk and seek work,"" notes the british home office website. hsmp differs from the work permit scheme as it does not require an employer to obtain a permit from the individual. and, there will be no limit on the number allowed to enter under the system. it is also different from the existing business routes like the innovators scheme or other business categories. the scheme will initially be run as a concession outside the current immigration rules. from 28 january 2002, applications will be assessed on a point-based system of qualifications and experience. to be considered for the scheme an applicant will need to obtain a minimum of 75 points from the five following scoring areas: educational qualifications, work experience, past earnings, achievement in chosen field, and a specific category that will help facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified overseas doctors to work as gps in the uk. the point system for educational qualifications offers a maximum of 30 points for those holding a phd, 25 for those with a masters degree and 15 for those with a graduate degree. an applicant would score 15 points for at least 5 years of work experience in a graduate level job, while for three years with a phd. additional 10 points for two years working at a senior level or in a specialist position within chosen field. past earnings area requires demonstration of a minimum earned income in the country of residence. income points have been adjusted to take account of differing pay scales around the world. someone earning 250,000 pounds a year in america would get 50 points. whereas someone from india, china, pakistan, bangladesh or zimbabwe would only have to earn 15,000 pounds a year (rs. 10 lakh) to get the same number of points. applications must be made before entry into the uk can be obtained through the home office or foreign and commonwealth office websites. applications will also be accepted at the nearest british embassy or high commission and referred to a central unit in the united kingdom. successful applicants will be granted leave to enter the uk for one year, and after this further sanction to remain will be granted if evidence of employment is supplied. it also allows the candidates already in uk, those who are graduating from a uk university, or completing their post-graduate medical studies, to apply whilst remaining in the uk, provided they have not been sponsored by their home governments. lord rooker said that this programme represents a further step in developing uk's immigration system to maximise the benefits to the uk of highly skilled workers who have the qualifications and skills required by uk businesses to compete in the global marketplace. ""it will allow eminent scientists to base their research projects here,"" he added. this is to encourage the movement of business and financial experts to uk and give those at the top of their chosen profession the choice of making the united kingdom their home. applications for this program will be handled by a central unit of immigration staff based in sheffield. the programme will run for an initial period of 12 months. if this pilot program is successful, the ministry plans to launch a similar scheme for low-skilled category immigrants next year.

13,"No illegal beacon lights on vehicles, govt orders","mumbai: the state administration on saturday directed senior ias officials including principal secretaries, secretaries, additional municipal commissioners and sub-divisional magistrates among others to immediately remove the red beacon flashlights fixed atop their official vehicles. such officials are among the scores of other political dignitaries who are not authorised to use red beacon lights on their official cars. however, in absolute disregard of the rules governing the use of such special privileges, officials not only drive in cars with red or amber beacon lights but often the vehicles are misused for personal work. following a review of the security arrangements in the city in the wake of the murderous attack on parliament on december 13, the state transport department on saturday decided to strictly enforce procedures on the allotment of vehicles with red flickering lights. ``section 108 of the central motor vehicles rules, 1989, has named the dignitaries who are entitled to blinkering type red lights on their official vehicles. in keeping with this rule the state government has listed 25 top dignitaries who are to be given cars fitted with red lights and have identified 11 senior officials for use of cars with amber beacon lights,'' a senior mantralaya official said. as per the rules, only the governor, chief minister, cabinet ministers, minister of states, judges, chief secretary, additional chief secretary and secretary to the chief minister among others are to be provided with official cars fitted with red beacon lights. ``there is no provision for principal secretaries or secretaries in mantralaya to use cars fitted with a red beacon light. but all these high-ranking officials have fixed the removable magnetic lights atop their vehicles and have also fixed an air-conditioner which is also illegal,'' a senior official in the general administration department told this newspaper. the rules also specify that only 11 government officials are entitled to cars fitted with amber beacon lights. ``this list includes revenue commissioners, district collectors, police commissioners among others. we have added the name of special public prosecutor ujjwal nikam in this list as it essentially deals with officials who are working in law-enforcing agencies. the blue or purple beacon light is to be used by ambulances,'' an official said. mantralaya officials pointed out that cars with red or amber flashing lights which are seen as a symbol of authority have been misused. ``in many cases where a minister is also a chairperson of a public sector undertaking he is given a second car. this car is fitted with a red beacon light but is ultimately used by his family for their personal work or is put to use by his personal secretary.'' ``similar is the case with ias officials who in their capacity as secretary to a department are also managing directors or vice-presidents of a board and as such are entitled to another vehicle. very often the officer keeps this second vehicle for his family,'' officials said. chief minister vilasrao deshmukh, who held a meeting at varsha on saturday to discuss security arrangements in the aftermath of the attack on parliament, has asked the state administration to strongly enforce the law regarding the use of red beacon lights. at the meeting, mr deshmukh instructed officials to take steps for strengthening security at the airport, the sea port, the vidhan bhavan, mantralaya and other key government installations. mr deshmukh has appealed to citizens to be alert and observe restraint and not fall prey to rumours.

15,Other side of 'ideal' labour law,"kolkata: despite having the most ""ideal"" labour laws in the world, less than half the total workforce in the organised sector in india are covered under the employees' state insurance scheme. more than two-thirds of the total working population in the country remained beyond the bounds of health insurance coverage. these startling facts came out during the inaugural session of a two-day workshop on ""rights of the workers _ esi and occupational health"" in kolkata on sunday. ""even in labour-friendly west bengal, health coverage for workers is nowhere near the mark. nearly 73 per cent of workers in the state are deprived of health benefits,"" utuc general secretary sunil sengupta said. the workshop has been convened by nagarik mancha, an ngo working in the field of occupational health for over a decade. ""till 1997, there was no system for identifying occupational health-related diseases. today, 162 persons have already got or are awaiting compensation,"" nagarik mancha general secretary naba dutta said. the current condition of the esi was criticised by almost all the speakers. ""the esi is now in a very weak condition. it is now practically an extra source of income for the workers in collusion with a section of doctors,"" sengupta said. the most severe criticism, however, came from a most unlikely quarter. ""almost everyone today is irritated with the condition of esi. despite having huge sums of money at its disposal, wrong policies and corruption have made the esi schemes practically non-functional,"" superintendent of the esi manicktala hospital kunal dutta said. dutta gave details of the esi's finances. ""the esi corporation has fixed deposits in nationalised banks worth rs 2,250 crore, and another rs 3,500 crore lies with the central government. its surplus of income over expenditure stands at rs 1,600 crore,"" he said. the lion's share of this money comes from the workers' pockets, which is siphoned off by the centre as profit under a different name, he alleged. yet compensation or developments remain elusive. ""tuberculosis is one of the most common diseases connected with occupational health. yet, there is no specific tb programme of the esic,"" dutta said. preventive programmes like vaccinations or health check-ups are hardly taken up. ""the workers' movement has to be strengthened in order to ensure that the benefits reach the people for whom they are intended,"" he said. esi officials tried to defend the corporation's activities. ""we do not have much to do regarding the formulation of policies. these are mostly decided by the standing committee of the esi, which is composed of noted personalities from labour and industry as well as the government,"" esic deputy director (eastern region) anjan dutta said. ""it is not that we are not doing anything. but things are taking time,"" he added.
