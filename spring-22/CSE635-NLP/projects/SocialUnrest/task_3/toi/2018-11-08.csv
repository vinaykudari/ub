0,`No tie-up for polls; RKP chances good: Kalyan,"lucknow: rashtriya kranti party (rkp) president kalyan singh on wednesday said his party would contest all the 402 assembly seats in the state. talking to reporters, the rkp president said his party would not enter into an electoral tie-up with any political outfit in uttar pradesh. he said his party might become the single largest group in the vidhan sabha leaving behind many others in the race. the rkp, he said, was receiving overwhelming support from the people and this would be visible after the poll results. criticising the chief minister for his ""boastful"" utterances, singh said rajnath singh was under the impression that there was a wave in favour of his party, whereas no such thing was visible to others. the bjp, he said, would be drastically reduced in size after the poll. kalyan said the statement of the chief minister that he would contest the poll on aatankwad(terrorism), aarakshan(reservation) and atal was a shrewd move on his part to put the onus of the party's poor performance in the coming election on the prime minister. if atal behari vajpayee had been a charismatic leader, the party would not have lost all the 14 lok sabha seats in the lucknow division in the 1999 poll, he said. on poto, singh said it is more draconian then any other law enacted so far and would enable the government to curtail individual freedom without inviting any interference from the court. such a law, he said would make the law enforcing agencies insensitive and ruthless. the rkp leader said if he had been vested with powers to run the country, he would have asked the army to annex the pak occupied kashmir and destroy the terrorist-training camps there. singh said the statements issued by prime minister vajpayee and also by home minister advani against pakistan's role in supporting terrorism lacked depth. drawing a parallel, singh said that us president bush had asked afghanistan to hand over bin laden to them, or face a war with the americans. but when advani asked pakistan to return maulana masood azhar, the home minister had no guts to say such things to that country, said the rkp president. on kalraj mishra's statement that the bjp would make ram mandir a poll plank, he said there was no consensus in the bjp on these issues. the rkp president accused the government of indulging in bribes in conducting the group c examination. he said 14 lakh youths who had filled the forms for the examination had come to realise now that they had been duped by the government.

ew delhi:chief minister rajnath singh is busy removing all hurdles. angry state employees being placated with extension of retirement age, teachers assured new scales as per fifth pay commission and jobs thrown open to most backward category - the indications are enough to suggest that state will go polls in mid february. even as chief minister confirmed in new delhi on wednesday that elections would be held in februray, political pundits in lucknow have even given the dates . according to them, elections would be held between february 9 and 14. they are not speaking through their hat. one of the close cm aides told times news network on wednesday that rajnath wants an early election. ""politically, timing suits us as all sections of society - be it traders or state employees, youth or farmer - are singing paens of cm,"" he said but added: ""cm is also forced to hold elections in february because of coming winters."" rajnath has not confirmed this, in so many words, but had told this newspaper that he wanted to write to election commission in december about conducting elections in up . if cm wants election in february, then why he wants to write to ec in decemeber? his aide also has an answer to it . ""cm does not want to face winter session of the assembly with opposition benches presenting a deserting look. this may give bad publicity,"" he said. so, as per the tentative schedule, the cm would write to the ec by december end to hold elections . as it is mandatory to hold elections within 41 days after government's request , most suitable timing for elections would be mid- february. in new delhi the cm said, ""the schedule for the assembly elections will be such that the next government is formed by february 2002 and the bjp will go to the polls with performance as its main plank."" he said ayodhya was not an election issue for bjp and was being played up by the opposition for creating a sense of fear among the minorities. with this aim the opposition had objected to the prevention of terrorism ordinance (poto) and was demanding lifting ban on simi which described j&k as not a part of india, he said. demand for ban on bajrang dal was irrelevant and a similar decision in 1992 had been struck down by courts. ""bjp wants to create a sense of confidence not fear to win over the minorities,"" singh said, adding terrorism as an issue was also bound to crop up during the elections, even if the bjp did not raise it on its own.

11,No revival of temple issue before polls: Rajnath,"new delhi: uttar pradesh chief minister rajnath singh has ruled out any revival of the ayodhya issue by the bjp in the run-up to the state assembly elections. ""the bjp will not reopen the temple issue, nor has it done that before,"" singh said. ""we will fight the elections on the basis of our achievement in office,"" he said. the cm, however, was on the defensive when asked about the purpose of creating the ayodhya cell by the centre. he said the vajpayee government was keen to resolve the dispute on the basis of consensus. his government, singh said, would extend all cooperation to the centre in this regard. the cm had an awkward moment when it was pointed out that the retirement age for the state government employees had been raised to 60 just before the elections. similarly a drive has just begun to fill in the vacancies. ""should i stop working for the people till the elections are over,"" he shot back. assailing the political parties which had opposed the ban on simi, he wanted to know whether they were aware of the student organisation's support for the separatist forces in kashmir. he accused the opposition of creating the ""bogey of communalism"" before the elections.

12,Dons warn govt against intellectual terror,"new delhi: placing the ""historical"" fight in contemporary context, prominent historians and history teachers on tuesday said that the vajpayee government could not contribute to the fight against global terrorism if it engaged in ""intellectual terrorism"" on its own academia and denied debate and dissent. with this, the fight that first took place during the 1977-79 janata era has entered phase two. meeting under the aegis of sahmat, they accused the government of promoting ""communalisation of history"". ""it is denial of history,"" they maintained at a day-long seminar. the historians took note of the ""enthusiastic endorsement"" of the government's plan to re-write history books at a recent rss rally in nagpur, and observed that the decision that history books would be subject to pre-censorship by religious leaders ""is portent of things to come."" ""any undermining of history as a discipline cannot but affect the entire quality of academic life in the country,"" a statement warned. ""communalisation has entered a new phase in the country. it needs a new strategy,"" said prof k n panikkar. would it help to drag the government to law courts where historical issues and history teaching could be put to judicial scrutiny, a history teacher asked. panikkar said he was not sure whether such a course would help. ""we will have to wait till the fall of this government,"" prof arjun dev, who earlier wrote books for the ncert, said. the history dons were clear that they were not against rewriting of history books per se, which was ""a continuing process"" that must be carried out. their objection was to the ""unscientific manner"", and the injection of religion and communal overtones into the books. again, they were not against religiosity, which was different from communalism or fundamentalism. the difference was illustrated by prof amiyo bagchi as the one between maulana abdul kalam azad and mohammad ali jinnah. ""advani is not a fundamentalist,"" he clarified. the marxist historians said what had been attempted by r s sharma, romilla thapar, irfan habib and others, which was now being rejected, was a critical view of the indian society down the ages. a critique of women's status and caste system does not amount to their denigration as was being accused by the sangh parivar protagonists. prof satish chandra summed up the argument saying that the only yardstick to view history should be as part of the struggle for human rights.

13,Forest minister keeps vigil through BJP network,"ahmedabad: call it a 'parallel forest department' or a forest brigade, minister of state for forest dolatbhai desai will be using his own network of bharatiya janata party workers and locals to keep a vigil on the rampant tree felling in the state's forests. ""on the very third day of my appointment, i got a truck-load of trees being smuggled confiscated. this was on the basis of the vigil maintained by my workers. i have asked them to keep a watch and keep me informed"" , he told the times news network on monday. the minister minces no words and makes it clear that he does not want to create any formal set-up or give it any name. ""you know how difficult it is to ensure that nobody misuses such a position. so i have decided to keep myself informed about what's going on where, with the help of a few trustworthy workers, without setting up anything."" and his decision is paying him rich dividends, in barely two weeks. desai has unearthed another major scam in the forest department - which is believed to be full of many more scams. he got the tip-off from a worker after he held a meeting of workers appealing them come out from inaction and start helping the government. at velanpur village of navsari, he found that the government was being cheated in auction of trees. ""in one instance, it was found that instead of 1,000 cubic metres of wood, only 21 metres was shown. the auction would then take place for all these trees but the government will be paid only for the 21 metres!"" ""i went to the spot in the morning and summoned an official there. we measured that just five trees were 21 cubic metres. there were hundreds of trees. this kind of cheating occurs everywhere. so i want to stop it immediately,"" he says. his next target is to stop the sale of good timber at the rate of fuel wood. ""there is a bungling in the upset price also. besides, they pay much less than what is fixed for the auction."" desai makes it clear that he would not deter from taking decisions on scandals and scams that have taken place in the past. ""i have no problem in taking action in such cases, if the files are placed before me,"" he says. conceding that kher-wood smuggling is still rampant in the state, he attributes it to the delay in payment to the farmers during auctions. ""you will soon see that things change"", he aserts with an air of confidence. forest ministers have traditionally dithered from taking tough decisions - be it the decades' old case of shifting some lions to a safe place or creating a mechanism to protect the marine national park. there is no denying that a good change is what the state's forest department needs at this juncture, if one wants the 25 sanctuaries and national parks to survive.

14,"Forget downsizing, state govt is gathering more flab","gandhinagar: gujarat seems to have completely given up on downsizing the government, a pledge made initially about a decade back and reaffirmed by the bjp rulers when they came to power. if anything, the government is getting bloated with each passing day. an internal official note has found that the state government's plan to effect a 10 per cent cut in the state administration, initiated on october 28, 1991 has been ineffective even after a decade. it has also found that fresh plans drawn up by the bjp rulers to go in for further 10 per cent cuts on september 9, 1998, and finish with a 20 per cent cut in the state administration by march 31, 2000, is still on in the reverse direction, despite the expiry of the date 20 months ago. the note, which has been marked 'confidential', complains, ""things have not progressed as desired. difficulties in implementation are unsurmountable."" circulated for comments and discussed at several secretaries' meetings, held every tuesday, the note puts forward the findings of a committee headed by senior ias officer a w p david to point out that out of the 4,01,292 government jobs in 1991 for which details were obtained, in a decade only 32,153, or eight per cent jobs, have been abolished. ""several departments have not furnished full details"", the note says. today, the total number of government employees, including panchayats, are 4,68,034. this excludes employees working in state-owned corporations and grant-in-aid bodies. handed over to a senior asian development bank consultant recently to study the effectiveness of government plans to downsize the administration as part of the state's fiscal reforms, the data given in the note suggest that two years ago, the total government employees' strength was considerably less - 4,51,747 and the size of the administration had reached 4,67,976, as on march 31, 2000. of course, there was a slight deceleration in government employees working in line departments, from 2,45,780 two years ago to 2,44,387 today. but this is less than 0.6 per cent cut, a far dream from downsizing the administration as desired. as for the panchayat employees, the numbers have gone up from 2,05,967 to 2,23,674! not without reason, the total amount state spends on government, including panchayat employees, too, is up from rs 3,886.22 crore in 1999-2000 to rs 4,114.19 crore in 2000-01. giving separate details of 43 government-run boards and corporations, the note suggests that here also the cut in administration is meagre - from 1,51,121 employees in 1999 to 1,46,523 today. the cut is of merely 3.1 per cent, though here the plan, as worked out in september 1998, was to effect an extra 10 per cent cut by march 31, 2000. despite having frantically tried to obtain details, the david committee has failed to get any statistics on the number of employees cut in grant-in-aid institutions. the worst performance in effecting a cut in the employees' strength was that of the state home department. though the desired numbers to be cut in two years, as fixed in 1998, was 13,253, by 2001, a mere 2,128 were cut. many of them police constables. despite the cut, the total number of persons working in the home department has gone up from 79,226 in 1999 to 80,679 today. the best performance was that of the industries and mines department, which cut down 3,155 jobs instead of the desired 2,623. the employees' strength in several government boards and corporations, despite the official aim to withdraw from economic activity, has been going up. the gujarat state road transport corporation (st) strength is up from 59,839 in 1999 to 61,189 today; the gujarat electricity board strength is up from 50,402 to 51,003; and the sardar sarovar narmada nigam ltd strength is up from 9,131 to 9,247. on the other hand, some of them, such as the gujarat maritime board has brought down the strength from 3,414 to 3015; and gujarat mineral development corporation from 3,245 to 2,912.

15,Sonia's Mehsana rally a challenge to Modi,"gandhinagar: farmers are emerging as the most wooed section of society in the state these days. take the state government's reluctance to meter power connections or increase tariff, or its defence of the bt.gene cotton crop. but, the opposition also sees an opportunity here to tap the dissatisfaction among the farmers with an eye on the elections to 10,000 panchayats due next month, which is going to be the first test for narendra modi's leadership. all india congress committee president sonia gandhi would address an estimated two lakh farmers at a kisan rally in mehsana on friday, the opposition party's first political challenge to the ruling bjp in the state after narendra modi took over the reins a month ago. the significance of the venue should not be forgotten because modi belongs to mehsana district and may decide to contest from here to enter the assembly in the next five months. congress leaders are already at work. most of them are rushing to north gujarat _ patan, banaskantha, sabarkantha, mehsana and gandhinagar _ to gather support. state congress chief amarsinh chaudhary, congress legislature party chief whip naresh rawal, members of parliament shankarsinh vaghela, madhusudan mistry, atmaram patel and pravin rashtrapal are working overtime to make the rally a success. the effort is to focus directly at the farmers' plight, taking advantage of the bjp's still indecisive policy on power, water and support price of the crop. rawal told tnn that the main issue to be raised would be opposition to the meter system that the bjp government has been imposing on the farmers at a time when water table in north gujarat has dived. ""if in other areas tubewells of five horse power (hp) are enough to pump out water, in north gujarat the farmers have to use 60 hp pumps to take out water from 1,000 ft and more,"" he said. though the modi government promised that it would provide power 14 to 16 hours to north gujarat, the farmers are getting power for only half that time, rawal says. yet, they are being charged for 18 hours a day. the other main issue would be the bt cotton issue. ""the seeds were all certified by the state government, but now it is trying to backtrack on the matter. we have no problem if a decision is reached to burn down all cotton crop, but we will sharply oppose any move to do that without giving any compensation to the farmers. who gives it, whether gujarat or centre, is not our problem,"" rawal said. with the agenda set, the bjp has begun backtracking on power reforms. already, representations have been made to the gujarat electricity regulatory commission to not to make meters compulsory for the next five years and even reduce per horse power rate of power. interestingly, plans to make water a costlier commodity to be sold at a price because of its scarcity, too, remain on paper. the talk of a water regulatory authority for that has not made any progress, even as fresh blueprints are being worked out to transfer narmada waters to new north gujarat areas. the state government also decided to reject any formal order from the centre to burn the bt cotton produced from the controversial genetically engineered seed. congress insiders say that north gujarat remains the best bet for the party because it is here that the congress won the most lok sabha seats last time. the congress is also banking on the fact that with the exit of keshubhai patel, it could tap the disaffection of the powerful patel community which is in large numbers in the northern districts.

""we have 13 vacancies for security personnel which will be filled up at the earliest,"" shah said. ""in fact, we are planning to double the number of such personnel and have already received approval for it."" the tenders for the new canteens will also be issued soon. however, the authorities have refused to concede to the main demand of the a, c and d block students _ which is suspension of 11 students from the b block, whom they allege have been responsible for the violence. ""we have already suspended 14 students from the hostel for six months,"" dean k v bhatt said. ""we cannot take any further action until the police inquiry is completed."" the internship of five students has also been extended by 15 days as a punishment, he added. a and d block students, on the other hand, remained adamant and are not ready to call off the strike until the 11 students are suspended from the college for a semester. of the seven admitted to the hospital, two are girls. they agreed to taking drips only at 5 pm on wednesday even though they were admitted on tuesday.

25,BJP bolsters its government at the cost of the organisation,"ahmedabad: exactly a month after chief minister modi took charge, while the government may be donning a fresh look, the ruling bjp appears drained of its drive and resources. the bjp is struggling to find direction following the elevation of state organising secretary sanjay joshi as the party's national general secretary and induction of another general secretary, gordhanbhai zadaphia, as minister of state for home. they were the most powerful figures in the organisation along with state bjp president rajendrasinh rana. there is more bad news for the bjp with reports circulating that rana, mp from bhavnagar, may also be on his way out. this is particularly disconcerting for party cadres who are gearing up for the crucial elections to nearly 10,000 gram panchayats in late december. the state bjp functionaries were caught unawares when sanjay joshi was suddenly shifted to new delhi within days of the smooth change of guard in gandhinagar. an rss nominee who wielded absolute power in the state bjp, joshi had taken over the party reins after the banishment of modi. joshi was popular with the cadres though senior bjp leaders had problems with his style of functioning. but nobody would dispute the fact that he had complete information about ground realities in almost every taluka of the state. senior bjp functionaries and those of the sangh parivar had drawn the attention of the central leadership towards the crisis in the organisation after joshi and zadaphia were moved out, but bjp president jana krishnamurthy had other ideas. it is believed that modi plans to overhaul the bjp in his own way, but has kept the cards close to his chest. the state bjp leaders are eagerly awaiting a replacement for joshi which is likely to some from the rss. warned a senior bjp leader, ""any delay in the appointment of a new organising secretary will cause immense damage to the party at this crucial juncture when panchayat elections are due next month and assembly elections in 15 months' time."" some senior bjp leaders owing allegiance to the rss have recommended the name of pravin maniar, one of the most senior rss leaders, to replace joshi, but the party is in a dilemma whether he should step into the shoes of someone much junior to him. maniar, it is felt, will also have problems dealing with modi. another name doing the rounds is that of bhikhubhai talsania, organising secretary of rajkot city bjp. he is in the good books of the sangh parivar and has an excellent track record in the organisation. ahmedabad bjp president mayaben kodnani is also among the list of probables, but party sources feel she has not yet attained that stature. but a section of the rss leaders is advocating her name. meanwhile, it is learnt that the bjp's central leadership has asked sanjay joshi to stay for 10 more days in gujarat even while discharging his duties at the national level.

29,Stay questioning Lakhani's election vacated,"vadodara: a city court has vacated a stay order that had challenged m s university students' union (msusu) general secretary mehul lakhani's contesting and subsequent election to the post. the stay was vacated on wednesday. former general secretary of commerce faculty students' association amit ghotikar had challenged lakhani's election in the court. ghotikar objected to lakhani's employment with the vadodara municipal corporation, arguing that the very fact that lakhani was employed makes him ineligible to contest students' union elections. however, the argument was not considered valid or justified to remove lakhani from the elected post. ""i was having a part-time employment which in no way breaches the norms of the msusu. the nsu-i was not able to digest its defeat and hence decided to make an issue out of my part-time job and tried to harass me,"" lakhani said. he has now filed a caveat in the upper court. ghotikar's counsel narendra tiwari, on the other hand, has asked for more time from the court. ""unlike some former nsu-i student leaders, i did not take money from students promising them admissions but took a part- time job. what i did is a legitimate way of earning a little while studying,"" lakhani said.

30,Donor bank reads riot act on municipal graft,"kolkata: a stern guideline to curb corruption has created a stir in the calcutta municipal corporation. tight-lipped officials confirmed on monday that the asian development bank, which is likely to release the first instalment of a rs 1,600 crore loan by the end of december, wants the cmc to maintain a strict vigil. the guidelines arrived just as the cmc is shortlisting national and international firms for project management consultant (pmc), design, supervision and construction(dsc) firms, public relation consultant (prc) and ngos required to execute the project. the adb has recently sanctioned rs 180 crore as grant for upgradation of present infrastruction within the cmc. the rs 1,600 crore loan is meant for upgradation of the city's drainage system (in added areas), solid waste management and slum development. a 19-page booklet sent by adb contains details about what would be deemed as corruption. besides streamlining the selection procedure of consulting firms, the adb has put a bar on the receipt of ""gifts"" above $10 by either the cmc or bank officials themselves. according to adb officials, exchange of gifts can indirectly influence the tender procedures. the adb seems to be taking no chances keeping in mind the case of a world bank consultant who had received a gift from a cmc employee but returned it after discovering that the gift was a sandalwood elephant priced above $10. the adb has defined corruption as ""behaviour on the part of the officials in the public or private sectors by which they improperly and unlawfully enrich themselves and/close to them, or induce others to do so by misusing the position in which they are placed. it includes the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting of anything of value to influence the action of any such officials in the selection process"". by fraudulent practice the adb means a misrepresentation of facts in order to influence a selection process or the execution of a contract to the detriment of the borrower. the bank has made it clear that the selection of firms will be made on the sole basis of qualification to perform the work. ""the proposals received in response to the invitation should be carefully analysed and compared with respect to experience and capabilities,"" the bank says. the adb officials are carefully monitoring the selection procedure by periodically sending teams from its delhi office. ""we are aware of the corruption guidelines and are trying our best to enforce them,"" director-general (project) raghbendra das said.
