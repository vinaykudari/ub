0,"‘MCH polls, time to humble BJP, TDP’","hyderabad: the cpm workers have been urged to strive for the defeat of both telugu desam party (tdp) and bharatiya janata party (bjp) in the coming elections to the municipal corporation of hyderabad (mch). several party leaders who addressed the activists at the cpm city-unit 16th annual conference here on thursday criticised the state and central governments for adopting 'anti-people' policies at the behest of the world bank. senior leader s veeraiah said the series of strikes by the employees of revenue department, apsrtc and singareni collieries goes to prove the indifferent attitude of the government towards the interests of workers in the state. he said the world bank was influencing the state and central governments in adopting new policies as well as in making amendments to the existing legislations. the people are vexed with the governments and they will definitely prove their resentment by defeating them in the mch elections, he said. the party's city-unit secretary p s n murthy said the state government's alleged move to constitute a water regulatory commission has proved true the cpm's fears about the privatisation of the water board, which he observed, would deprive the poor of their basic needs. asserting that the rich cannot afford to buy the water while the poor are denied that, murthy said the g o v e r n m e n t s which were adopting the liberalised policies should be defeated from coming to power in the municipal corporation. if tdp or bjp comes to power, people will be burdened with more taxes and anti-people policies, he said. describing the telangana sadhana samithi (tss) and telangana rashtra samithi (trs) as divisive forces, murthy called upon the workers to defeat both the parties. he wanted the party activists to strive to make cpm a major force in the municipal corporation elections. he urged the activists to be prepared for a fight against the government's decisions which are not in the interest of the poor. senior leader parsa satyanarayana attended the conference as observer. leaders including s n reddy, j venkateshwarlu, k ravi and aruna addressed the party workers. state-unit secretary b v raghavulu also attended the meeting.

1,CPI to protest water board privatisation,"hyderabad:the state council of the cpi has threatened to launch direct action, in january, if the government does not desist from its moves to privatise the water sector. speaking to reporters here on thursday, cpi state secretary s sudhakar reddy debunked the government's and world bank's line that an approximate 4 to 5 per cent hike in water charges may be necessitated due to the losses incurred in the water sector caused by the policies of the previous governments. the government is bent on privatising the water sector under pressure from the world bank and its decision to constitute a water regulatory commission is a prelude to this, he said. it may be recalled that the cpi had already organised state-wide dharnas on the issue. it now proposes to conduct seminars in all the municipal towns to educate people about the government's intention to deprive them of their fundamental rights. on the offer by the congress mlas to quit assembly if the government fails to contain factionalism, sudhakar reddy bemoaned that the menace of factionalism was so widespread that chief minister n chandrababu naidu himself expressed concern over the increasing political murders. he remarked that the tdp which suffered during the congress rule was now indulging in the same practice. stating that the cpi mandal parishad members as well as the party's former mla k ramakrishna were also facing threat to their life, reddy demanded that the government provide security to ramakrishna.

4,Charity begins and ends in minister’s constituency,"gaya: if the interest shown by the bihar energy minister shakeel ahmed khan in the revival of the abandoned and economically non viable power sub station project for gurua, the constituency which send him to the assembly after a hat trick of electoral defeats, is any indication, charity, for him begins and perhaps, also ends in the rather non descript extremist stronghold. the project, started in the year 1983, was soon abandoned when the electricity board found it to be non viable. besides, they also found long history of electric wire theft in the adjoining areas. when khan, the local mla, was made the bihar energy minister following the creation of jharkhand, he became virtually obsessed with the gurua sub station scheme and accorded it top priority at the cost of other more useful schemes. as per available records, 443 of the 513 state tube wells in magadh division comprising the five districts of gaya, nawada, aurangabad, jehanabad and arwal are defunct on account of non availability of power. prolonged closure of the state tube wells have also caused mechanical defects and most of these tube wells have even lost connecting wire to the gang of wire thieves who are believed to operate in collusion with the electricity board staff. in gaya district alone, only 5 of the 77 state tube wells are functional. instead of focussing on the power problems of the tubewells, so vital for irrigation in the region, khan almost single-mindedly pursued his constituency agenda to make the sub station functional at gurua before diwali. though, the minister finally succeeded in getting things done for his constituency and got it commissioned by bihar chief minister rabri devi on november 12, the opportunity cost (output of the money, had it been put to some other more productive and optimum use) is much more than the bearing capacity of the resource-starved electricity board. the rather fast execution of the gurua power sub station scheme also underscores the point that given strong political will, alibis like viability and resource crunch become meaningless. moreover, khan has also somewhat unintentionally aroused the sleeping expectations of his constituents who have got an almost unending agenda. though he defends his pet project by maintaining that he has only set right a two-decade long injustice as the sub station should have been there in gurua long back, he can not escape the charge of playing to the gallery at the cost of public exchequer, says a business leader who prefers anonymity. if you can not provide adequate power in the commercial areas of gaya town, from where the board gets most of its revenue, every unit of power supplied to gurua would be at the cost of the paying consumer said the businessman. gurua voters think entitled for free power supply, remarked dcc vice president mohd moosa.

5,DSP issues orders against political interference,"pune: district superintendent of police dr madhav sanap has warned staff of the pune rural police that he will take action against anyone who tries to pressurise him into giving them favourable postings by citing recommendations from elected representatives. in a circular issued on november 11, and which has been sent to all police stations in the district, dr sanap has clarified that under the rules it is not possible to post staff at police stations where they had earlier worked, or to police stations in whose jurisdiction their native village is located. if anyone brings him letters from mlas, mps, mlcs or ministers urging such postings, it will be considered as a violation of the police manual and action will be taken against those who bring such recommendations, including recording the matter in the confidential report of the concerned staff and instituting a departmental enquiry against him. dr sanap has also directed station-in-charges to read out the circular at least thrice to all staff and post it in prominent locations in police stations. it is reliably learnt that dr sanap took the decision because the number of such interventions by ministers, chairmen of various state-run corporations and elected representatives had increased substantially. it is common for politicians to issue recommendation letters for policemen seeking transfers. if the policeman is from their constituency they sometimes even call up the superintendent of police 'requesting' him to agree to the transfer to the desired police station. transfers made on such recommendations can create incredible problems. for example, a constable from, say, khed police station brings a letter from a minister recommending his transfer to, say, shirur police station. a constable from shirur is then sent to khed police station as a replacement, but if this transfer is not to his liking, he may bring a letter from another minister requesting that his transfer be cancelled! when contacted, dr sanap tried to play down the incident: ""it's a routine order, nothing unusual about it. every now and then such orders are issued and this order has been issued to make policemen aware about the rules and procedures,"" he said. he denied that interventions of this nature have increased in recent times or that he had issued the orders because he was fed up of pressure being exerted on him by politicians. just for the record, there are three cabinet rank ministers from the district, one guardian minister and two ministers of state and many chairmen of state corporations.

6,"Prepare for talks with Pak, Manmohan tells govt","new delhi: whether it wishes or not, india at some stage will have to negotiate with pakistan and should do homework to ensure a better performance than at the agra summit, opposition leader manmohan singh said in the rajya sabha on thursday. singh was initiating an inconclusive discussion on the international situation and india's response to it in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks. external affairs minister jaswant singh was present throughout the three-hour debate. prime minister vajpayee also came for a little while. the debate ran on predictable lines. speakers from the ruling coalition said the government had done a good job and those from the opposition said it hadn't. a common thread, however, was the concern at the lack of full appreciation of india's stand on kashmir and terrorism in the us and other western countries. singh said a common point made by all the leaders whom the pm had met during his recent visit abroad was the need to resume a meaningful indo-pak dialogue. he said at some point, india will have to start the negotiation process with pakistan. india's policy should be a lot clearer than seems to be the case, said singh. he made a number of points on the alleged tardiness of the us government in banning terrorist kashmir groups, on the reported contacts between taliban sympathisers and pakistani nuclear scientists and the various moves to form a new afghan government. singh wanted to know what the government was doing about all this and why it wasn't more active and effective. nilotpal basu from the cpi(m) was critical about us policy and the vajpayee administration's reactions to the post-september 11 developments. we are just going along with us urgings, without clear thought or a recognition of the need to rally other developing countries against a unipolar imposition of views, he said.

8,MP govt to clamp down on forced conversions,"bhopal: in a fairly significant change in political stance primarily aimed at countering the bjp, madhya pradesh chief minister digvijay singh declared on thursday that his government would clampdown on forced religious conversions on the one hand and arm defenceless dalits on the other. talking to mediapersons in the assembly, digvijay said forced conversions — whether from hinduism to christianity or vice versa — would be checked. the cm confessed that communal incidents targeting christians had been reported from indore and ujjain in recent weeks. the jhabua incident on november 15 in which communal riots between two communities broke out over the bursting of crackers had caused considerable consternation. pamphlets carrying photos of the monkey god hanuman with the message rashtra virodhi isai ke khilaf sunghursh karna hai (anti-national christians will have to be fought) had been retrieved from dhar, khargone and jhabua districts. digvijay said that since only a small fraction of dalits had arms, the state government would, if necessary, step in to fill this gap. the cm also expressed the fear that the bjp may use the provisions of the prevention of terrorism ordinance to spread its brand of ""cultural terrorism"". the recent statements of union home minister lk advani that whosoever was anti-poto was pro-terrorism and that the bjp would stand to politically gain regardless of whether the ordinance came into effect or fell through had hurt sentiments across the political spectrum.

10,No amendments yet on terror law: Oppn,"new delhi: voicing strong reservations against the anti-terrorism ordinance at a meeting of home ministry's consultative committee, opposition parties on friday said the government has failed to come up with any amendment to the proposed law, but agreed to meet again on monday to discuss the issue. somnath chatterjee of the cpm told times news network that the meeting was unproductive and the whole incident was just an unfortunate drama in which the opposition got trapped in. terming the 90-minute meeting as inconclusive, bjp member madan lal khurana indicated that the government could consider dropping certain controversial provisions from the prevention of terrorism ordinance to protect freedom of the press. chatterjee said he had opted to keep out of monday's meet and said he had told home minister l k advani that his absence does not mean acceptance of the terror law. he further said even nda allies, particularly vaiko had reservations about the law. the opposition members were of the view that the government should have consulted political parties before deciding to promulgate the ordinance. minister of state for home i d swami said the opposition mps agreed that there should be a law to fight terrorism, but the government should have held wider consultations before bringing poto. swami said the opposition members wanted more time to suggest specific changes in the proposed law. advani told the meeting that conviction rate under tada, which lapsed in 1995, was low as mobile phone and other intercepts were not permitted as evidence in courts, according to official sources. he cited the example of the law against organised crime in maharashtra and said conviction under it was high since intercepts were treated as evidence like under poto. swami said the opposition mps were not specific about amendments to the proposed law. the consultative committee would now again be held on monday, the minister added.

16,Prostitution racket busted in govt quarters,"rajkot: it was the last place, the police would have thought, where a prostitution racket would flourish. even after a tip-off was received, their doubts remained. but on friday, when they raided a house in government staff quarters near kidwainagar on ring road, the men in uniform succeeded in busting a prostitution racket and arrested eight persons including three women. city police commissioner sudhir sinha had been tipped off about the flesh trade being conducted by a tailor couple from a house in block no 59 of the society. according to the police, those arrested included a 60-year-old retired morbi college employee, kaushik vrajlal mehta. others held were, pranjivan sanghani (40) and tribhovan valji adroja (36) hailing from morbi, prashant gohil (24) from thangadh and ramji sakaria (35) of rajkot. the women arrested were usha bhikhu chitroda (20), a resident of lalpari, shital bhatti (20) from rajkot and meena raja (32). while usha and meena were working as sales girls, shital was employed at a private hospital. according to the police, the business was being run from the house of nimu harish chavda and her husband harish. the police said that the couple had resorted to it after they failed to make both ends meet with their meagre earnings from repairing torn clothes and other minor tailoring assignments. while some of the residents of the colony were taken aback when the police raided their colony, others had doubts about the goings on in the colony, but dared not to ask.

17,Coffee Day rally hits the roads today,"mangalore: while the himalayan and the desert tracks are the pride of indian motor sports, of late, racing is gaining momentum across the country. the coffee day action rally is to be flagged off on saturday in mangalore, as the last leg of national rallying. anwar manipady, closely associated with racing, traces how the sport revved up in the late 60s and early 70s. it was then in the nascent stage with a few scattered events bringing in excitement. ""as a youngster, taking part in small events in bangalore on agram circuit and the nandi hills climb, we were aware of being far behind the western world in motor sporting. however, there was confidence and enthusiasm which laid the foundation for the growth of the sport,"" he recalls. racing has had a bumpy ride, and looked up for both the country and the state when the likes of nazir hussain took to it. it was a delight to watch the stern-looking hussain in his `double barrel textile industry special' souped-up car, manipady recalls. hussain let free the spirit of motor sporting, and youngsters adopted it. in the 70s, the late gopinath siva added his bit to the scene. sponsors hitched their brands to the bandwagon, with unstinted support from vijay mallya and tyre biggies like mrf and jk. however, the real boost came in the late 80s when the traditional rallying of tsd (time speed and distance) format transformed into `stage' rallying. it was then that many more corporates came forward to sponsor racing events across the country. the trend continued for quite some time only to hit some bumps when ""a few individuals who wished to garner all the glory left the sport in a lurch"", according to manipady. injudicious decisions and bad planning added to the setback. but both the sport and its association revived, when nazir hussain, rich experience behind him, took the mantle of the motor sports association of india. there was committed support from farhad bathena and other enthusiasts who gave the sport a shot in the arm. rallying returned to the fast track in less than two years. in the late 70s and early 80s, rallies like k1000 and the mysore safari were local favourites. dakshina kannada had its share of professional rallyists in jayaraj shetty, jnandev, ishak bamson and satish babu, who burnt a lot of rubber to popularise the sport here. ""this inspired us to organise ourselves, and form the karavali automotive sports club in 1985,"" manipady recalls. this put mangalore on the motor sporting map of the country very firmly. the city also produced promising rallyists like aroor ashok rao, satish bhat, moosa sharief and others who carved their names on the national circuit. then came the fall, as the sport went through a slack period. but motor sport has an irrepressible spirit: the vacuum was sensed and those with speed in their blood came together with hussain, farhad and tony rodrigues of mrf. dakshina kannada and udupi was where the seventh leg of the national championships was held last year, but it was marred by varied problems that resulted in the rally being called off mid-way. this year's rally, promise organisers, will be a runaway hit.
