1,Will AMC’s chhota peg be followed by govt Patiala?,"AHMEDABAD: When the political bosses of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation recently decided to slash octroi duty on licensed liquor by almost three-fourth â€” from 25 per cent to 7 per cent â€” members of the ruling Congress party scarcely thought the move would be a cakewalk.

But apart from a token resistance by the Opposition BJP, there were virtually no protests from powerful Gandhian and womenâ€™s groups, who are sworn to prohibition in Gandhiâ€™s Gujarat.

In fact, this radical move on a subject which is considered politically hypersensitive went almost unnoticed and some in the government, particularly in the industry and tourism departments, are taking this as an encouraging sign if the state government is to relax prohibition laws. The state government had, earlier this year, simplified the cumbersome procedure to get a liquor permit and opened counters at airport for permits.

Although licenced liquor accounts for just a fraction of the total liquor that flows in Gujarat, mainly through bootlegger cartels, the official position so far has been to keep on mounting taxes on licenced liquor which primarily services about 23,000 â€˜health permitâ€™ holders in Gujarat, besides tourists and business travellers.

When the AMC invited objections and suggestions for the proposal from concerned parties, no individual or institution objected to the huge duty cut. The decision to slash the duty was first cleared in the 2003-04 budget. The AMC then invited objections by placing advertisements in newspapers. When there was no response, the proposal was cleared by the octroi committee.

The proposal will now be sent to the BJP-ruled state government. AMC sources are confident the duty cut will sail through because the octroi levels on liquor in Ahmedabad have now been brought on par with other cities in Gujarat which are under the BJPâ€™s control.

The BJP, however, is not giving up without a show of resistance. â€œHow can we encourage people to consume more alcohol. Also, the cash-strapped AMC will lose out on revenue,â€� says BJP councillor Prafull Rawal, a member of AMCâ€™s octroi committee.

However, Congress sources say the AMCâ€™s annual income from octroi duty on licensed liquor is just around Rs 28 lakh out of a total octroi collection of Rs 363 crore.

â€œPeople preferred buying licenced liquor from outside the corporation limits. Hence, we had to slash the rates,â€� says Badruddin Sheikh, a member of the AMCâ€™s standing committee.

Mayor Aneesa Mirza believes the BJP is displaying double standards. â€œIn BJPrun civic corporations, the octroi rates on liquor are in single digits,â€� she says.

However, many see the silence over the duty cut as a manifestation of the perceptible change in the attitude of the authorities as well as people. Theatre personality Raju Barot,who has a health permit, says â€œWhy would anyone go for illegal stuff if one gets the right stuff.â€�

Darius Merchant of Taj Residency Ummed said, â€œThe slashing of rates will benefit licence holders.â€� Hoteliers say by the time a liquor bottle worth Rs 100 reaches the permit holder in Gujarat, the price crosses the Rs 300 mark.

2,"CAS chaos still on, govt says regulator","NEW DELHI: The government, which remained a mute spectator for three days to the blackmail of South Delhi residents by cable operators, seems to have finally woken up.

The subject is understood to have been discussed at the PMO on Wednesday and the government has decided to stick to CAS but ""address consumer concerns"". An interim regulatory body is now in the works - an industry chamber has already been sounded out to prepare the modalities.

The entertainment tax department of the Delhi government has stepped in, stating that the cable operator is bound to make information on pay channel prices and other details pertaining to CAS freely available.

In case of any violation by the cable operator, the government has asked consumers to complain to the deputy commissioner (revenue), local sub divisional magistrates (SDMs) or assistant commissioner of police.

While this provision is already there in the Cable TV act, the Delhi government is obviously reacting to the public outcry to consumer rights being ignored in the name of implementing CAS.

The Delhi government - which has already constituted a committee on CAS - will meet on Thursday to deliberate with consumer bodies, Multi System Operators and other industry representatives. A senior I&B ministry official will represent the Central government.

There has also been a partial climbdown from pay broadcasters and cable players in agreeing to beam Star Plus, Zee and Sony in the free-to-air mode till the end of the month.

""They are mass channels and do not have pay channel content. Consumers should wait and watch,"" says Viky Choudhary of the National Cable and Telecom Association.

Meanwhile, 40 RWAs of the Delhi Joint Front have demanded an interim regulator for the broadcast sector. The government should not ask consumers to approach SDMs or ACPs, the front said.

""Nothing will happen if you complain to an ACP or SDM,"" says VC Tandon secretary general of the Joint Front. ""When telecom sector has TRAI, insurance IRDA and small investors have SEBI, why can''t we have a regulator for TV?""

The Joint Front has also demanded a standard proforma of agreement to safeguard consumer interest. ""Consumers are asked to sign agreements with cable operator for buying set-top box. Government should not be silent and have a standard agreement,"" says Tandon.

3,More road funds must: minister,"BANGALORE: Days after chief minister S.M. Krishna announced the release of Rs 1.25 crore per Assembly constituency towards road development, a senior minister said this was ""insufficient"" to meet the needs.

Speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony for four-laning a 13 km Kundalahalli-Sai Baba Ashram stretch of the Bangalore-Varthur road here on Wednesday, social welfare minister A. Krishnappa said: ""This amount is insufficient, it needs to be doubled or trebled. Particularly in this new taluk of Bangalore East, which has so many IT parks, roads need to be developed and it requires more than Rs 1.25 crore.""

4,TDP MPs meet CEC; press for early polls,"HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party on Wednesday urged the Election Commission to hold polls to the Assembly preferably in February 2004 or latest by the first week of March.

A delegation of TDP MPs led by K Yerrannaidu called on chief election commissioner J M Lyngdoh in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum listing the compulsions of the state government.

The memorandum said that nearly 11 lakh students would be appearing for the SSC and Intermediate exams beginning March 17.

The SSC exams would be held at 4,445 centres spread across the state and 63,189 personnel including invigilators, superintendents, departmental officers and flying squad members would be busy conducting the exams.

Subsequently, from April 2-15, 32,768 examiners and other staff would be required for spot valuation. Similarly, the Intermediate public examinations will be conducted from March 17 to April 6 involving 13.3 lakh students. Over 40,000 invigilators and other staff would be required for the smooth conduct of the exams.

This would put an enormous strain on the administrative machinery to hold elections, the memorandum said. It also pointed to the difficulties in passing the budget for 2004-05 in case elections were held beyond March. The TDP leader told the CEC that the draft publication of electoral rolls would in the state would be over by January 20.

Even if the poll notification by the Election Commission is issued in about a week from the date of final publication of electoral rolls, it should be possible to hold elections by mid-February and certainly well before the SSC examinations commenced.

5,State govt to exempt SSIs from 50 paise power tax,"BANGALORE: The 50 paise per unit electricity tax on captive gensets will be withdrawn for small-scale industries, large and medium industries minister R.V. Deshpande said on Wednesday.

Speaking after commissioning the Cauvery water supply project to the Peenya Industrial Complex, Deshpande said CM Krishna, who has realised the problems to be faced by SSIs after implementing the proposed tax, will make the announcement shortly.

Deshpande said industrial areas in the city will be supplied Cauvery water in the next six months. The BWSSB has completed the work of laying feeder mains in the Complex from Hegganahalli Reservoir, constructed under Cauvery Water Supply Supply Scheme, Stage IV, Phase I at a cost of Rs 2.6 crore.

Bangalore city development minister R. Ramalinga Reddy said the seven CMCs and TMCs around Bangalore will be supplied Cauvery water in a year for which tenders will be invited in January. However, the project will be commissioned in Kengeri and Yelahanka TMCs in the next five months.

6,‘Most injuries in riots due to police firing’,"HYDERABAD: Over 90 per cent of the bullet injuries received by people during the recent riots in the Old City were due to shots fired from weapons of police personnel, said director of Andhra Pradesh Forensic Science Laboratory (APFSL) K P C Gandhi on Wednesday.

Investigations on the injuries of the dead as well as the injured were undertaken by APFSL scientists, he said at a seminar on forensic sciences organised by the Hyderabad chapter of the Indian Science Congress.

The statement by the Forensic Science Laboratory director confirms a statement by FSL sources earlier that they found samples of ammunition used in selfloading rifles, .38 mm and 9 mm weapons which are meant to be used only by police and defence personnel.

However, this by itself is not a guarantee that all bullets came from service weapons, an official said. All that the Forensic Science Laboratory has established so far is that the wounds received by people came from weapons of the calibre of .38 mm and 9 mm ammunition that are used by the police and other security forces.

And since many such weapons with the exception of self-loading rifles are also in the possession of criminals, one cannot say that every bullet injury suffered during the riots came from shots fired by service personnel, the official explained.

7,SC notice to Punjab govt on SYL canal,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a notice to the Punjab government on Haryana''s application seeking a direction for the completion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal by the Centre in a time-bound manner.

The Punjab government has been reluctant to complete the unfinished portion of the SYL canal â€” a bone of contention between the two states.

A Bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P V Reddi has asked the Punjab government to file its reply within two weeks.

Haryana''s counsel Shanti Bhushan pointed out that the apex court had on January 15, 2002, directed the Punjab government to complete construction of a small portion of the SYL canal by January 31, 2003.

The Centre had agreed to construct the incomplete portion of the SYL canal in Punjab, but requested the court to direct the Punjab government to render all cooperation.

Bhushan said as Punjab has failed to comply with the directions by January 31, the other part of the apex court''s order â€” asking the Centre to complete the canal â€” should be given effect to by entrusting the work to a Central agency.

When Punjab sought time to file a reply to the Haryana government''s application, Bhushan said this was not necessary as Haryana was seeking the Centre''s help and not from the Punjab government.

Bhushan asserted that the time taken by the government for the filing of a reply was a ""delaying tactic"".

8,Foreign investment crosses $7b in '03,"Mumbai: India has become one of Asiaâ€™s hottest destinations and itâ€™s not just the tourists who are clocking in. On Wednesday, investments by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in 2003 crossed the $7 billion markâ€” more than double the previous high of $3 billion recorded in 1995.

And with good reason. The benchmark BSE Sensex has set a scorching pace this year, giving returns in excess of 60 per cent during the calendar year. According to brokers and dealers, strong economic fundamentals â€”on acomparative as well as absolute basisâ€”the positioning of India as one of the most promising emerging markets in the world, and the performance of the corporate sector were among the main reasons for frenzied buying by foreigners.

Naina Lal Kidwai, vice chairman & managing director of HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, said that FIIs were buying Indiaâ€™s growth story and this eventually percolated down to stocks. â€œThe underlying story is very good and with a GDP growth of seven per cent forecast, the country is attractive to any foreign investor.â€™â€™

Moreover, attractive stock valuations wee also playing a key role in attracting foreign funds. â€œIf you benchmark the earnings of Indian companies to their Asian peers, stocks here are still relatively undervalued and hence the FIIs cannot ignore this rally,â€™â€™ said Ms Kidwai.

Going by the monthly inflows, FIIs have already pumped in $914 million in December, the second highest monthly inflow so far. The highest was in October, when foreign funds infused $1.4 billion into the market.

Brokers say a number of FIIs registered with Sebi but inactive until recently have also started buying as their clients want the India presence felt in their portfolios.

According to Ambareesh Baliga, vice president, private client group, Karvy Stockbroking Ltd, given the fact that the investment of these new buyers in India is not a substantial portion of their total corpus, they are not much bothered about the price and the fundamentals of the stocks they want to pick up. â€œBy year-end, they somehow want the India presence highlighted in their portfolios,â€™â€™ Mr Baliga said.

9,"Panchayat polls: Caste, rivalry matter","CHANDIGARH: Development? Forget it. It is caste and personal rivalry that seem to matter in the canvassing for the panchayat elections in 17 villages scheduled to be held on December 21.

Barring two or three villages, it seems to be an issue-less election campaign. While the old players are playing a key role by using their influence in the favour of the candidates, most women in the fray are ""dummy"" candidates put up by former and sitting sarpanches for their own interests.

In the upcoming model Kaimbwala village, the three candidates for the post of sarpanch have no issue as most of the demands of the villagers have already been approved by the UT administration.

The former sarpanch, Sher Singh,was a consensus candidate, and is a relative of one of the candidates. But because of one dissenting group, there is going to be an election here this time.

In Dadu Majra village, it is Sainis versus the Chowdherys. Here the only factor which is likely to affect the outcome of the elections is anti-incumbency. Fore sitting sarpanch, Bhag Singh, and his family the sarpanch''s post has been in the family from the past 30 years.

The former has been a sarpanch for 20 years and his wife Leela Devi for five years. This time their 29-year-old son is in the fray.

Villagers say that Bhag Singh has done nothing and they want a change this time. For the first time, the Chowdhery community has put up their man.

Dhanas, where the sarpanch''s seat is reserved for a scheduled castes, it will also be an issue-less election. Here both the SC women candidates are ""dummies"".

While Surinder Pal Kaur is the daughter-inlaw of former sarpanch Dayal Singh, Surinder Kaur is supported by sitting sarpanch Harbhajan Singh. Both had little to say about the problems of the villagers.

The position is almost the same in Khuda Lahora where three women candidates are in the fray, out of which, one is wife of sitting sarpanch and another the mother of a former panch. The third one is representing the reserved category.

But their special mantra goes something like this: ""We will listen to the problems of women, which males cannot understand.""

It is the same story in Khuda Jassu where Surjeet Kaur, the wife of sitting sarpanch Balbir Singh is pitted against Sawaran Kaur, sister-in-law of former sarpanch Mohinder Singh.

While the former is trying to encash on her husband''s performance in the last term, the latter promises to upgrade the school of village and to set up a new dispensary.

10,TDP leaders want polls to be advanced,"NEW DELHI: A delegation of TDP MPs on Wednesday met EC officials and sought early assembly elections, ""preferably in February and not beyond the first week of March"", on account of certain ""compelling reasons"".

The delegation, led by party leader K Yerran Naidu, met Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh and the other two election commissioners, T S Krishnamurthy and B B Tandon, and submitted a memorandum from Andhra chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

In the memorandum, Naidu said that from March 17 to late April, it would be a ""strain"" on the administrative machinery to hold elections in view of the SSC and intermediate examinations.

""Not only will a number of teachers not be available for poll duty, the availability of educational institutions for polling and counting purposes would also pose a problem,"" he said.

11,"Bhutan arrests top Ulfa, KLO leaders","KOLKATA/GUWAHATI: The Royal Bhutan Army''s offensive against Indian insurgents operating from its soil entered a crucial phase on Wednesday, with the arrest of some top leaders of the United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO).

Among those arrested were Ulfa publicity secretary Mithinga Daimary and KLO leaders Tom Adhikary and Milton Barman, sources said. Daimary has been handed over to the Indian authorities and sent to Rangiya in Assam for interrogation.

12,House panel pulls up govt on Arjun tank,"NEW DELHI: The project to build India''s own main battletank ''Arjun'' was conceived over 25 years ago but the Army still continues to wait for it.

Dubbing it a serious blow to the indigenisation process, Parliament''s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has pulled up the defence ministry for this ""inordinate delay"".

The committee, in its action taken report tabled in Parliament on Monday, said the date for raising India''s first ''Arjun'' tank regiment had already passed without any of the tanks rolling out. This has hit the crucial plan to replace the ageing ''Vijyanta'' tanks.

The committee also expressed concern over the sharp increase in foreign components in the Arjun prototypes, which comprise almost 60 per cent.

The report said the committee had been informed that the first ''Arjun'' tank regiment would be raised in 2002, with two more regiments by the end of the 10th Plan in 2007. But this did not happen.

Concerned that the delay would have a serious adverse impact on the entire planning in respect of equipping the Army, the committee asked the defence ministry to closely monitor the production schedule at the Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi.

The defence ministry, in turn, told the committee that the production of the ''Arjun'' tanks had commenced with the release of an indent by the Army for manufacture of 124 tanks.

Expressing dismay that not even a single tank had rolled out from the Avadi factory till now, the committee said production should be stepped up and the tanks be made available to the Army in the stipulated time.
