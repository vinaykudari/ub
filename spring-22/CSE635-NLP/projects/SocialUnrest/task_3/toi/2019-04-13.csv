2,Sena’s march sparks fresh violence in Kalyan,"kalyan: curfew was imposed in kalyan (west) on friday evening after a mob burnt shops and establishments belonging to members of the minority community. the trouble followed an unruly morcha by 3,000 shiv sainiks, who marched through the shivaji chowk area to protest tuesdayâ€™s violence in the townâ€™s rohidaswada area. ignoring the pleas of their leaders, thane sena chief raghunath more and the partyâ€™s thane mp prakash paranjpe, the marchers stoned the window panes of a house opposite the office of the deputy commissioner of police, even as members of the state reserve police force (srpf) and the rapid action force (raf) stood by. the marchers later handed over a memorandum to thane police commissioner s.m. shangari. fresh violence was reported at 6.15 p.m. opposite the office of thekalyan-dombivli municipal corporation near shivaji chowk despite a heavy police presence. the police said that the warehouse of a marriage tent supplier on the ground floor of the yakub manzil building was set ablaze. the flames spread to a neighbouring lodge and a maternity home. ten fire engines were pressed into service and the fire was still burning at 9.30 p.m. shaken kalyan residents criticised the police for allowing the morcha to be conducted despite tension in the town. but a police official contended that â€œunless the anger of the sainiks was allowed to dissipate by allowing their morcha, more problems would have resultedâ€™â€™. the morcha was ostensibly called to demand the arrest of nationalist congress party corporator iqbal shaikh, who is wanted for the rioting and arson that took place on tuesday night in rohidaswada, a colony of cobblers in the old township. local residents allege that mr shaikh, wanting to settle political scores, had instigated the rioters, which had led to the death of sena worker ashok walunj (34). walunjâ€™s home and that of several others in the locality were set ablaze.walunjâ€™s aunt, ambibai (65), died of shock when she saw him being killed. another woman, nusrat chowgule, died in the police firing. samir shaikh, a tonga-driver, was stabbed in a retaliatory attack the same night. his condition is said to be serious. before fridayâ€™s incidents, the police had placed 120 people under preventive detention and arrested 40 others for tuesdayâ€™s arson and rioting, said kalyan dcp kiran shelar. more than 100 persons had been named tuesdayâ€™s first information reports about the riots, of whom 90 had already been arrested. four companies of the srpf and two of the raf had been stationed in the troubled areas.

4,Tata Hospital implements new rules,"mumbai: tata memorial hospitalâ€™s governing councilâ€™s new rules came into effect on april 1 and some doctors, especially surgeons, are unhappy about the restriction on their private practice, which have reduced their monetary incentives. tata memorialâ€™s director k.a. dinshaw says that the situation at the hospital has changed and the doctors are required to devote all their time to the hospital. dr dinshaw says that an institute cannot afford to favour any one group of its staff over others. â€œit leads to management problems. in fact, other staff in the hospital have been discontented because surgeons were reaping maximum benefits from private practice,â€™â€™ she says. the ongoing tugs within tata memorial hospital reflect critical issues faced by several public hospitals. how can a government institute, which canâ€™t match the salaries of the private sector, retain good doctors? how does it strike a balance between social goals and market demands? some doctors feel that despite the ban on private practice, tata memorial will continue to attract the best professionals.â€œas a doctor at tata memorial, you can set clinical trends for the rest of south asia. you are invited to international conferences, and there is immense peer recognition,â€™â€™ points out s. pradhan, who recently left tata memorial for prince aly khan hospital. others are less optimistic. they fear that surgeons will stay on for a few years to obtain experience and reputation, and then jump ship under the lure of lucre. the management should provide better remuneration for public sector doctors, they add. â€œotherwise, there will be a gradual attrition of talent, especially at the senior level,â€™â€™ predicts a doctor.
