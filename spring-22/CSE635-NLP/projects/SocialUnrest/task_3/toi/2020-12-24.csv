0,Officiating principals: PU mulls norms,"CHANDIGARH: Panjab University is weighing different options of regulating the term and procedure of appointing officiating principals in its affiliated colleges.

Though the committee that met last month had recommended that officiating principals should be appointed in accordance with the rules of the university and their appointment be made maximum for a period of six months, the recommendations were not approved by the university''s governing body senate last week as the house felt that there was a need of adding more college principals on the panel for a comprehensive decision.

Among the recommendations floated to streamline the entire process of appointing officiating principals, the committee had also added that the colleges should be advised to initiate the process of selection of the regular principal three months in advance of the date of retirement of the principal. Another strong recommendation is to get the process of selection completed within a month of retirement of the regular principal.

But the members, giving a reference to the government colleges in city where it has become a norm to appoint officiating principals one after the other, say that when it comes to ground realities it is the college managements that dictate the terms rather than the university norms.

""While on one hand the university is reminding the colleges of its regulation by suggesting that an officiating college principal''s term should not exceed six months, on the other hand there are so many government colleges in the city which are continuing to have officiating principals for years together. Even in some private colleges in the city the officiating principals have continued upto three years despite the continuing rules of the PU.

All these regulations do not appear to provide any concrete solution and would remain on papers,'''' said Principal of SGGS college PS Sangha and president of the college-principals federation.

""The university rules are flouted everywhere. For example in Guru Nanak College in Ferozepur Cantt, the officiating principal appointed by the management is ranked much lower in seniority rather than the norm of the university where senior most lecturer is to be appointed. Finding good principals is tough task and managements dictate their terms while appointing the heads. What can the university do remains to be seen'''' observed a senator.

The senate had decided that the committee, with addition of more principals, would submit a report on the recommendations next month.

1,Pawar politics angers Bhujbal camp,"MUMBAI: The Chhagan Bhujbal camp in the NCP is seething with anger at party chief Sharad Pawar for â€œheaping injusticeâ€™â€™ on its leader.

Sources said Mr Pawar had forced Mr Bhujbal to step down as deputy CM on Tuesday although the latter had suggested that he be allowed to continue as deputy CM without the home portfolio.

The NCP chief had called Mr Bhujbal to his residence on Tuesday and, after a general discussion on state politics, had abruptly asked him to quit in view of the controversy over the fake stamp paper scam.

Mr Bhujbal initially asked for two daysâ€™ time to mull over the request, the sources added. When this was rejected, he requested that the home portfolio be taken away from him but that he should be allowed to continue as deputy CM. That too was shot down by Mr Pawar, who asked him to â€œresign immediatelyâ€™â€™.

When Mr Bhujbal reportedly pointed out to Mr Pawar that the latter had given him a clean chit only a few days earlier and had ruled out the possibility of his resignation, the NCP chief said there was a strong possibility that the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is probing the scam, would summon him (Mr Bhujbal).

That would cause enormous embarrassment to both the NCP and the Democratic Front government in Maharashtra in which it was a junior partner, Mr Pawar said.

With Mr Pawar giving him no room for manoeuvre, Mr Bhujbal sent in his resignation to the chief minister on Tuesday.

Although Mr Bhujbal said he had quit owning moral responsibility for an attack by NCP activists on the offices of a TV channel, sources said the real reason was Mr Pawarâ€™s diktat.

Meanwhile, the Congress is believed to have opened a line of communication with Mr Bhujbal. Senior Congress leader and minister for industries Patangrao Kadam called on Mr Bhujbal on Wednesday and was closeted with him for more than 15 minutes.

A senior Congress leader from Delhi is also believed to have called up Mr Bhujbal, although the latter has denied it. Political observers note that Mr Bhujbal has seldom criticised Congress president Sonia Gandhi, unlike Mr Sharad Pawar.

Mr Bhujbalâ€™s supporters said a senior NCP leader had been upset with him ever since diamond merchant and film financier Bharat Shah was arrested in January 2001.

â€œThis leader, who enjoys the backing of the powerful diamond dealersâ€™ lobby, had put pressure on Mr Bhujbal to help Mr Shah. But Mr Bhujbal had pointed out that the Mumbai police had taped evidence against Mr Shah and any interference in such a sensational case would boomerang on the state government,â€™â€™ a source said.

Politically too, Mr Bhujbalâ€™s penchant for keeping a high profile had caused unease in the top rungs of the NCP, sources said. He effectively leveraged his position as deputy CM to emerge as a major leader of the OBCs, the category to which he belongs.

His political elevation had led to resentment among several Maratha leaders in the NCP, including Ajit Pawar, the NCP chiefâ€™s nephew and political heir.

Recently, Mr Ajit Pawar had launched a frontal attack on Mr Bhujbal at a cabinet meeting and this was followed by a campaign by several Maratha NCP ministers to have Mr Bhujbal sacked in view of the oppositionâ€™s allegations against him in the stamp scam.

Sources said that Mr Bhujbal was not planning any immediate political moves except perhaps to prepare his defence and that of his nephew Sameer in case they were called in for questioning by the SIT.

2,Homework ahead of polls,"NEW DELHI: Energised by the success of its micro-management in the recent assembly elections, where systematic surveys provided critical data, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has hired five market research agencies to survey 350 Lok Sabha constituencies and assess its chances in the general elections.

Each agency will undertake a survey of 70 constituencies â€” some new and some which the BJP won in 1999.

The results of the survey, party sources say, will be ready by mid-February. The sources add that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand will be the BJPâ€™s â€˜â€˜special focusâ€™â€™ states.

The survey will help the BJP categorise the various states on the basis of whether the party organisations there are weak, strong or â€˜â€˜borderlineâ€™â€™; and whether it will face one-to-one or triangular electoral contests and might therefore require seat adjustments with another party.

The survey will also identify constituencies where the BJP won or lost by a margin of less than 5,000 votes; work out caste equations in all constituencies being surveyed; help identify candidates which will then be given to a panel; identify senior party workers in every constituency; and provide reports on the performance of the sitting MPs to assess whether corrective measures are enough or whether a new candidate is called for.

The blueprint that has been drawn up by the BJP, and which will be finalised by its national executive in Hyderabad to be held on January 11-12, also envisages setting up media centres not just in the state capitals but all major cities and towns, party source said.

Campaign issues, national, state and local, will also be finalised in Hyderabad.

In the run-up to the Hyderabad meeting, starting on December 25 â€” to mark the Prime Ministerâ€™s birthday â€” the BJP will launch its â€˜Vikas Sankalp Yatraâ€™ and 50 of its central leaders, including top party functionaries and Union ministers, will tour the country till January 10.

3,Maharashtra govt to sell minority stake in MOIL,"NEW DELHI: Maharashtra government has decided to sell its minority shareholding in state-owned Manganese Ore India, agreeing to tag along with the Centre, which has put the company on the block.

In a letter to the disinvestment ministry, Principal Secretary (Industries) V S Dhumal communicated the state government''s intention to tag along with the Centre in the process, offering its entire 9.62 per cent stake, official sources said.

Earlier, the Centre, while deciding to sell 51 per cent stake in the company, had invited its two minority partners -- Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments -- to come on board.

An inter-ministerial group set by government is reported to have taken note of the developments and intimated the prospective bidders.

This takes the total percentage of shares offered for sale to around 68 per cent with Madhya Pradesh government previously agreeing to the deal.

Over a dozen bidders are reported to have expressed interest in acquiring stake in the company including Metdist, Monnet Ispat and Employees Union.

Centre currently holds 82 per cent stake in the PSU while the remaining 18 per cent is shared between the two state governments.

Maharashtra government''s move seems to have come in the wake of dire financial situation faced by it and compounded by the fact that undertaking this exercise at a later stage could prove to be a costly affair.

Government has mandated KPMG to act as advisors for the deal. Due diligence exercise has already begun with several parties having paid visits to the company mines located in central and western India.

However, the employees'' bid seems to have been rejected by the government on grounds that it did not meet the minimum eligibility criteria of Rs 75 crore.

The unions are learnt to be contemplating legal action against the government which could forestall the exercise.

4,India rules out demilitarisation of Siachen glacier,"SIACHEN: While expressing optimism that the upcoming Saarc Summit would lead to better relations in the region, India on Thursday ruled out demilitarisation of Siachen glacier unless differences with Pakistan were resolved.

""As long as there is a controversy, there can be no demilitarisation here,"" Defence Minister George Fernandes, who is on his 38th trip to the Siachen glacier, said.

After interacting with the troops on the Christmas day, he said, ""as and when India and Pakistan are able to resolve their differences and learn to live as friends, I see no problem in development along the glacier"".

He said onus of this friendship was on Pakistan as India had been facing its onslaught since 1947 despite having extended a hand of friendship umpteen times.

Fernandes, however, expressed optimism over the likely outcome of the upcoming Saarc Summit in Islamabad. ""From all the indications we have had so far, it should be a successful summit,"" he said.

The defence minister said he was hopeful because of the way things moved after the ceasefire was announced and enforced.

""There is a reason to feel that things can take the right turn,"" he said.

The defence minister said there could be certain compulsions which would enable our neighbour to take decisions to take the present situation forward.

Asked about these compulsions, he said, ""they are better not discussed"".

After the ceasefire was announced in November Fernandes said to some extent the infiltration has been reduced.

However, the jawans still deployed at the border are doing the same job to checkmate the infiltrators and displace them in case they cross the Line of Control (LoC).

He said the significance of Siachen glacier lay in the fact that it is a part of Indian territory. ""We do not need any other reason to hold onto it,"" he said.

5,"Early polls come closer, closer now","NEW DELHI: All indications are that the next general elections will be held ahead of the scheduled date in September, in May or even April, 2004.

Though a final decision will be taken at the BJPâ€™s national executive meeting in Hyderabad on January 11-12, senior party sources said the consensus building among party MPs was that the BJP should take advantage of the feel-good factor generated by the victories in the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and go for an early poll.

Party sources are citing two other reasons for advancing the poll dates: One, two key allies, the Shiv Sena and the Telugu Desam Party want assembly elections in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to be held along with the general elections.

Two, with the return of Rashtriya Kranti Party leader Kalyan Singh to the BJP imminent, the partyâ€™s problems in UP, which sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha, could be at an end. Party sources estimate Kalyan inside the BJP could add 10 to 15 LS seats to the partyâ€™s current score of 25 there.
