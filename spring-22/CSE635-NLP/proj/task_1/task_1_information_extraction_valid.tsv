A mini-bus loaded with explosives detonated at the main gate of Sahafi Hotel (Wadajir/Medina District) in the morning of 01/11 with unidentified number of al Shabaab gunmen storming the hotel as they exchanged gunfire with the security guards. A suicide bomber detonated a second set of explosive inside the hotel about 30 minutes later. NISAs especial operation unit called Gaashaan was deployed to the scene to battle with the militants. The siege lasted for more than four hours after which the AMISOM/SNG forces concluded the operation. The hotel is often frequented by Somali government officials, business executives and it has been also targeted before where two French security advisers were abducted from the hotel by al Shabaab fighters back in 2009. At least 15 people were killed (later estimated at 25), including the owner of the hotel, a parliamentarian and the attackers while score others were injured. Al Shabaab fighters immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.	01-November-2015	Undisclosed Source	12	Battles	Armed clash	AMISOM: African Union Mission in Somalia (2007-)	8	Al Shabaab	2	28	Mogadishu - Wadajir
A group of al Shabaab fighters (8-10 members) launched a well-organized attack against AMISOM base in Mogadishu known as Xalane base, which is very close to Mogadishu International Airport in the afternoon of 25/12. The attackers were reportedly wearing SNA uniforms, initiated the attack with a hand grenade attack. They managed to breach the base camp and attempted to gain access to critical infrastructure. It took AMISOM soldiers more than 18 hours to clear the compound. Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack as soon as the first shots rang out and later broadcasted that they had killed 17 AMISOM soldiers, including senior AMIOSM commanders and two white mercenaries. AMISOM said that they lost five soldiers and one of their contractors in the attack. The number of al Shabaab killed in the attack were not reported upon, though it was later learned at least some were killed as AMISOM forces later publicly displayed the bodies of the enemy dead as an act of discouragement for future attacks. A press release reportedly issued by the al Shabaab, claimed the operation was in revenge for the killing of the al Shabaab leader, Ahmed Aw Godane alias Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr and other Muslims killed in Somalia.	25-December-2014	Undisclosed Source	10	Battles	Armed clash	AMISOM: African Union Mission in Somalia (2007-)	8	Al Shabaab	2	28	Mogadishu - Wadajir
