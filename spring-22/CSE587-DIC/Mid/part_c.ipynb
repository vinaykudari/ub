    "The authors begin by discussing how big data analytical systems were critical in the discovery of the Higgs boson particle, and they go on to discuss how various fields other than physical sciences are leveraging the potential of big data. It has been reported that some astronomers are now frequently querying existing datasets to discover previously unknown patterns and trends, which is very interesting to know. Big data is also playing an important role in the healthcare domain, with many of these techniques being increasingly used to conduct comparative and longitudinal analyses of cancer treatment regimes. The author also discussed some lesser-known fields where big data analytics is being used; currently, semantic graph visualization tools and recommender systems are being used to identify relevant topics and suggest relevant papers for study."

    "The study explored a wide range of technological obstacles, including software, hardware, and scaling challenges. The author references a survey undertaken by the US Department of Energy, which claims that new designs and technologies are required to reduce the energy requirement to a more manageable and economically reasonable level in order to satisfy the present compute power demand. \n",

    "- More expressive programming methods are required to deal with the parallelism and frequent errors of exascale computing systems.\n",
    "- Given the need for systemic resilience in the face of component failures, systems should incorporate a wide range of resilience mechanisms, such as geo-distribution, automated restart and failover, failure injection, and introspective monitoring."
